This is a great looking device which ticks all the right boxes The only issue I have is with Auto brightness which is not as good as my previous Samsung phone however Auto brightness increases the battery life to great extent that was a big issue with Samsung so brightness is a tradeoff between battery life and display the only other annoying thing I found is not being able to swipe off notifications they take their own 23 seconds before disappearing,0
Though a capable midranger from a hardware standpoint,0
