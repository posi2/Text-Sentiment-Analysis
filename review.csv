Niccc, vry good
The packing is very good and phone is much better in that price range, better camera and gaming performance is best and the look is amazing
The one thing that was missing from the smartphones for the last two years i.e. Dedicated memory card slot has been brought to you back by Honor 8x again. I dont need to need mention the other fetaures here. 6 GB RAM+ 128 GB internal combo along with a extra slot for a memory card and Kirin 710 processor is a beast. Be aware RedMI, be aware.
Nice n so hot look
Dear flipkart I don't expect this from you your seller shipped this product in a cover my previous all products send you in a safe packaging box but now what happens to you you know this is a phone so need more safe covering but you don't provide that I totally disappointed to that phone is good and theirs performance is best so don't do that type of packing again

Amazing phone always been fan of Honor even my last phone Honor 6x has survived Water full of bucket, mud, cake cream, crashed from a bike. sounds unethical but its true this phone has same features of survival but specifications are exceptional Value to Money... 128GB internal storage with 6GB RAM is flawless its each image is about 5mb and so crystal clear like a pro cam.... its battery last so long sometimes 2 days if not used for games and ideal scenarios and even charge so fast...
I use this product 1 month really good and nice mobile..I m very happy.. value of money... go for it
A very good smart phone at a very reasonable price. 128gb internal memory with 6gb Ram at Rs. 18999/- is very reasonable. I am super happy with the phone.

Awsome Selfi... Loved it
I have use it till October it's work properly....good phone but problems is flipkart exchange offere if you give them a new phone for exchange they will find a problem and don't receive your old phone.... i also requested to flipkart please you stop your exchange policy
good
I bought the Oppo F9 as a stopgap, because I really wanted the bezel-less phones that are just around the corner. But in the meantime, my old phone was dying and there was a really good exchange offer on Oppo F9, which effectively meant I could get back what I had paid in full, in exchange for a new phone after 6-8 months. Of course, this meant that I would have to purchase my next phone on Flipkart itself, and also I could purchase only in the narrow window between 6 and 8 months of having b...

Good product..  very fast processor...  better than flagships... specially touch response ultimate...
Battery is superb with backup of 24+ hours. Camera is also superb. Screen of 6.3 inch is rarely good which is good in length but width is less.

Awsm Phone.. Fast Service By Flipkart
camera quality and everything is best and thanks for flipkart supporting group for allowing me to exchange my old phone at reasonable price.  so everyone must go for this phone compared to xaomi MI phone. And highly thanks to the wishmaster for delivery.
worst phone...camera quality was gud but not battery...much heating problem...processing also slow...
nice pise
it have great camera with oswm display.performance is very good as well as the look and feel with water drop display.its just oswm.and it is also give the good buyback value with the Flipkart buyback offer i like this offer very much. thankyou Flipkart..
thanks Flipkart. and the delivery boy to keep the exact words and timing for delivery
battery is not good 😡 while charging phone is heated camera is nice
some times touch doesn't work properly....otherwise good phone.... front camera depth mode very fantastic...
overally best phone to buy in exchange matter,(no compromise with camera and display performance)but battery back up is not good and not also very bad.
very amazing phone
Mobile is good, battery backup is good, display is very good, But front and rear camera is horrible. Worst camera phone in 19000/- price range. My acceptations was very high from this phone, but it's very disappointing.
Excellent mobile with wonderful features..Camera is awsome with lots of details but night mode is quite dissapointing.Processor is super fast with excellent ability of multi-tasking and battery backup is extremely good upto 2 days of backup with moderate usage. Display and overall presentation of mobile is really good.Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery during "Big billion" period and i got a great exchange value for my old oppo mobile by paying only 12240 rupees. What a deal...!!!!!!
camera my old phone f3pluse  camper not good .it 's OK not happy this price prafomanc. battery good but charz time long. Display not good. Display over white .performance very very good. nice look. this price display colorton not good. it's ok iam ***
I blamed camera is not well i expected
Selfie camera is fine for low light selfies. Everything is fine, only the display quality is not so good.  Camera is awesome. If camera is a great convern then you can go for it sure.
this product is good nice cam good battery but touch is not so good
very good performance in this price....
super machi......
nice mobile,  on time delivery
good
a unique design
Battery backup is very poor quality and I am not using data in this phone
Dont buy this phone instead you can byluy real me 2.pro. That phone has all the sabme features as this phone with better processor. In fact you will get better phone in less price than this phone ..
Everything works perfectly well only two issues I am facing 1. Downloading app from play store takes more time as compared to other mobile having same network. 2. In youtube the video is playing at a below average quality though my other phone with the same network and location can play it in full HD.  In WiFi everything works perfectly well even if it is connected with same network through hot spot.  Don't know the reason behind it.
worst phone, worst support from Flipkart. Very unsatisfactory
good deal with exchange  but don't buy with real price..
great phone.. good display.. awesome camera in both daylight and low-light... battery backup is OK... after 10 days of full use I can say it's really fast with great full HD+ display and brilliant camera along with premium look... and the phone also does not heat up with maximum use... overall a good product from Oppo...
very good.
good fone
warest mobile... camera was very bad... please take return mobile
After 3days usage..  I am not that proper satisfied with F9. 1) Slow-motion video quality is really terrible.. For 20k price we should expect good quality. 2) It's not wide angel selfie camera and you cannot click pics with finger print scanner. 3) In day and night light u get good picture quality.  4) Performance is OK and do not see any hanging problem yet but expect little warm while charging with internet on.  5) Snapdragon is always better than octacore processor as per my experience. 6)...
awesome phone
Mi note 7 pro isto much better than it
nice mob good display Battery backup was great
Excellent
nice phone
overall good..
Phone are much more hyped. I feel it is not that good. Screen are just OK. Performance is quite fine. Rear camera image quality are dissatisfied. Detail is missing. Front camera AI over beautification are added. And as usual Big dumbs down for proprietary COLOR OS. I think all Chinese smartphone players see borrowing each other OS themes and Modifing little some icons, color changes and using it. Huwai, Honor, OPPO Vivo Bla.. Bla.. All are the same.
best product in this range.  camera is super OK.
Excellent Device. Order this device on 26th October  and delivered by flipkart on 3rd November. I bought this phone in big billion day sale and grab awesome exchange offer. Box content - Phone, Charger, Micro Usb cable, sim ejector tool, soft transperent case, documents. After opening box I saw an eye catching phone wrapped in plastic sheet. First impression of phone is awesome. Phone look like a glossy piece of art. After booting this device first thing that really catch attention is screen....

Average
display and design very good.. camera good but i find it struggles a bit in low light but in normal indoor and daylight conditions camera performs superbly.... speaker is average..but what steals the show is its full view display with water drop notch....

Excellent mobile value for money I bought it 13000
I am satisfied with phone but not with Flipkart service regarding this phone worse service I had ever till now I had purchased this mobile with a buy back guarantee but Waste if i go for a exchange they don't even show this model under exchange. I want to buy oppo f11 phone we purchase the phone with buy back guarantee only to upgrade the phone with out any risk but here we have to face the risk pls don't buy the mobile under buy back guarantee as it is completely fake they won't give any BBG...

Awesome phone
Loved it

Nice handset in the price range
very nice deal.. superb mobile... superb camera
Good phone for somone looking for a phone with teardrop notch, decent camera and good build. The back is polycarbonate and the display is a fhd ips one. Nothing to write home about but the selfie and primary camera are ok for the price. Screen is okayish with a slight bluish tint. Bought it for my dad so pretty good purchase. Just dont expect this phone to blow you off your seats and you should be good. Brought it for 12999 on sale and given its pretty much a redme 2 pro clone save the system...

I bought OPPO F9 during sale at 12990, without discount it costs you around 17K. I got the delivery very next day in the evening. Coming to performance of handset it's really awesome. Camera is really fantastic,  battery with moderate usage long for 3 days bcoz I'mnt gaming addicted. Get charged fully in 2 hrs.  Best things it comes with headset and sound quality is fabulous, along with Sreeen protector n back cover. 5 star to OPPO.

some drawbacks of this set are.. 1-you can't set whatsapp dp directly from gallery. 2- there is no any indication light which can indicate that your phone is on charging OR you have a missed call. 3-D gallery doesn't fetch pictures automatically which are stored in phone memory.

Everything is awesome but battery drains a bit faster...But overall product is perfect to buy..

After 3 days of usage,  everything feels great except battery,  which drains relatively much faster for a new phone of such specs.  No other issue for me till now.
good
Review after using it for 15 days,  performance  is very good in terms of camera its excellent like other oppo phone,  speaker ultimate like dolby music system, battery has more than one day life after continuously using on data,  screen display classical.                             size is little bit big,  earphone quality can be improved
good phone average bty camera struggle in low light rest phone is super

Amaging

unbelievable 4GB ram phone is slow... multiple application not working phone slows down fast charging not available..otherwise okay
Worth to buy... phone is fast and sensitive touch screen. good battery back up.  quick charging. no notification lights and phone is little bit thick if you are using covers. no negative feed back from my side. fully satisfied
perfect camera phone..
osw mobile love it
it's a nice phone
it is like fluid
it's not handy and performance is notvas per our expectations. weight is also too much to provide pain to palm.
this phone is Beauty and the Beast
worst mobile am going to return it
Awesome phone
your luggage is very beautiful and the dilivery boy is very good and has dilivered the good on time. oppo mobile f9
nice phone
it's both 4g sim is not working properly and gets too much hanging issue, and restarting continuesly.
good
Great looking phone. I bought this phone because of two things look and Camera. Look wise the phone is just awesome. But a big let down for me is it's camera. The pics seems fine in the day light but in low light OMG there is a lot of noise. it's a big let down. Oppo advertise it's phones as Camera phone, but I don't think so. My much cheaper Vivo Y69 takes much better pics then it.
Not good
Need more battery capacity it's 4000
not worth of 18k
Best notch display
osm
Very cute  and smart mobile
i got it in 9000 during diwali sale...i got 9000 on exchange of my samsung on8...so it was a gud deal...n phone is also awesum....no any issue till now....

First I received mobile was not sealed pack n headphones were missing but Flipkart great service  replaced the mobile with sealed pack one n everything was there.

I bought this phone at RS 7900. Awsm phone but the battery backup is not that's great... But overall it's good at this price...
Very good phone at affordable price. Camera is excellent. Low light performance is excellent considering the price. Processor speed is very good. No lags observed in 10 days of use. Good offers by Flipkart during festive days. Speedy delivery by Flipkart.
best mobile very nice
I am fully satisfied
It's a good smartphone, but it's intended for offline market. So, it doesn't offer excellent value for money like Poco F1 or Realme 2 Pro. Beware of Flipkart's buyback policy. Your old phone should be like new, the delivery executives will try their best to reject the phone. Even very minor scratches or dents are not accepted.  The phone itself is good with excellent display and surprisingly good battery life for a 3500 mah battery. The cameras are good , but not great. Don't buy this phone w...

Good ofera
I'm writing the review after nearly two months of usage. I'm really concerned about the touch response of this phone. It's really not up-to the mark as it is slow /sluggish compered to others and the touch on the display is not so accurate. U have to struggle to get a response while typing/touching extreme bottom corners or trying to change alpha->numeric or vice versa. I have downloaded and tried to play chain reaction game which requires accurate touch response while filling up the boxes bu...

PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT AND VALUES FOR MONEY
amazing phone in this range
Nice product nice smartphone
best performance
good product
Well, for a moderate user like myself, the phone is good. It looks damn premium. Image stabilization while capturing video could have been better, reducing a star due to that. Not a good choice if you are a gamer since the battery capacity is less. I played PubG a couple of days though, without lag. Otherwise the phone is good. I got it for 13300 after exchanging my old phone for 4500. Also, i got buyback guarantee of 13000 for 8 months. So, overall happy with the phone.
Perfect look !
Camera and screen works awesome

Too early to give a performance review on phone.  Quick delivery by Flipkart. But the delivery boy was very reluctant to exchange the old phone. Unnecessarily was trying to tampering the old phone , so that it could not be exchanged. Somehow finally he exchanged it.
very good performance I loved it
Nice water drop display
excellent phone, thanks flipkart and oppo
good product
must miss oppo f9
Superb quality mobile
rear camera is poor. The pixels blasts in normal photos and opportunity apps pre installed in the mobile are very annoying!!
Amazing product at this price range. Exchanged my Asus Zenfone 3 Max and got this one in ₹10800/-. Certainly amazing value for money at this price. Design and display is really amazing. Performance from Mediatek Helio P60 is commendable. Mediatek is no more a slouch. Infact, it beats SD660 in Realme 2 Pro in Antutu benchmark by a couple of thousand points. Steller Purple colour is in very beautiful finish and surpassed my expectations with it. Color OS is feature rich but a bit on the heavy s...

Mobile is too good.. My five star rating is only for the mobile....                                                                  Exchange process is very bad..  even though my old mobile was working good which had zero damages.  I felt like they need very new mobile out of the box for exchange ... terrible experience.                                          I request you please make some changes regarding exchange .. it's not the old flipkart experience anymore

good  product overall I think but software/processor is little slow...
Totally waste of money product, I want to return this product but they provide replacement. All the problems are there like heating issue, over beautified camera, battery drainage. Totally pathetic device and unhappy with the performance. I was using oppo f3 plus which was far better and I was thinking that oppp f9 will be better but it is waste box.
All features in one phone..
good phone ...
good performance and nice look i am really satisfied in exchange offer.
good one, but expensive
It is early to provide comments regarding performance, however security such as screen lock feature through finger gesture and face detection not working properly.  Though there is lock enabled still phone get unlocked by swiping
I brought the phone 12000 with exchange PRICE. everything is awesome

beautiful phone on this price range.thx flipkart
Phone have all thing which any individual wish to have and of good quality,  but slightly disappointed on front camera. sensor is working fastly,  sound is awesome. overall it is best phone In its range
fantastic

Mobile is good but some time getting very slow
RAM management is not good, out of 4gb, it consumes more than 2gb anytime even after cleaning and boosting from the default app.I was able to see 1.7gb out of 4gb. Camera no doubt is good. Battery is okay so far. Fair decision to take in exchange in flipkart and not worth 18 plus price.
I am not happy with battery back up

Design can be made as a replica of oppo f9 pro.camera quality is not too good,actualy they are describing 16MP but act as 8 MP even struggling more during low lights,screen is good,atleast fast charging must be given in this price segment.AFTER MOBILE EXCHANGE IT CAN BE A VERY GOOD DEAL,OTHERWISE IT IS NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.

Very good performance, Smart selfie, worth for money
good product .delivery also good.thank you flipkart
this phone is exellent super duper
This is a great looking device which ticks all the right boxes. The only issue I have is with Auto brightness which is not as good as my previous Samsung phone however Auto brightness increases the battery life to great extent that was a big issue with Samsung. so brightness is a trade-off between battery life and display. the only other annoying thing I found is not being able to swipe off notifications. they take their own 2-3 seconds before disappearing.
Avg. Phone. camera performance OK in day light. battery backup is good.  heating issues on multitasking. cost is too high.
Though a capable mid-ranger from a hardware standpoint, software is a bummer. Couple of major nuances - lack of the "Display size" option in order to adjust DPI, and frustrating developer mode setting which keeps flashing at the top of screen. It's very disheartening to see such flaws with coloros, which Oppo as a reputed company should have taken care of. Even the company not releasing source code for the device is a pain, resulting in no development. In the end, not a happy customer! Long w...
suupprrbb product
nice phone over all!
not that much good..... always problems are arise... some time connectivity or some time sensor problem....

I got this mobile on Sunday 14.10.2018, and writing review on 19.10.2018. After using for 5 days, these are my observations 1. Display: crisp,  sharp, sun light visibility is good (I was earlier using moto g5 plus whose sunlight visibility was very poor also vibration issue there in Moto g5 plus), display quality is also good. you will enjoy it. 2. Camera : It is the area where I am not satisfied at all,  although the camera images are very bright but these are not clear,  surprised how other...

Based on the last two this is the ratings from me, got an update as soon as I booted the phone for the first time which is good, security patches are upto date, camera performance is outstanding in good lighting conditions and not very good under low light conditions. Will update the review soon after using the phone for a week or two. Thanks

Thanks flipkart for quick delivery.i got this phone only at 10k after exchange my samsung ON8...so its 5 star for value of money. below is phone prons and cons from common man point of view. dont go for expert advice.  good things are 1. screen is awesome ..premium full view display..i feel only app icon is bigger as may be i compared with my old samsung. 2. battery is good..100% battery is last long 24 hrs after continuous 4G On,1 hr game play,1 hr video streaming etc. 5 star for battery. 3....
this is my first oppo phone otherwise i am a fan of honor this time i want  to change my taste..so if you are looking for a good camera..vibrant display..good battery and blazing fast performance along with drop notch display then this mobile is for u..got it in 8000 due to exchange offers...thanks flipkart and oppo..
battery, display and processor is cons.... but its okey...
Till Now, i had a different perspective towards Oppo, But now i am proud to say the Best Mobile i havr ever used till now. Completely Satisfied with the product,it has many features which you cant get in any other mobile brand.
Rear camera not good at night vision...Battery backup fantastic...performance is good.overall worth for money..

amazing product.....thank flipcart
not as good
Needs to improve a lot. Can't delete multiple sms together. No battery full notification. No Led.  No Notification sound controller. Everything else is ok. Camera is perfect. Look is awesome but still not perfect mobile as per price.
When I was setting up the phone it was working slow, after setup it's going like butter. I wish they give 25 mp front camera, but it's okay, bcoz camera quality it very good except the slow mo camera. Battery is good, fast charging not like VOOC 😕 but charges fast, full battery in 1.5 hrs. 20 % increase in hqlf an hour. Almost same as oppo f9 pro. Bought it with exchange on price of INR 10340 in big billion days. 😊😊
Last 24 hour am using oppo F9,it's look,camera,and batry back up is nice...No beating issue.... Thanks flipcart for fast delivery in 2 days only.

Phone is good but camera is not good.....I am highly disappointed with the service of EXCHANGE. THERE WAS A SIMPLE SCRATCH IN THE BASE OF MY PHONE, VERY LIGHT SCRATCH BUT FLIPKART DIDN'T ACCEPT THE PHONE. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE OF FLIPKART. NEVER EXCHANGE ANY PRODUCT....
Great product
Good phone in reasonable budget
phone is very smart & price is very reasonable for exchange offer 13k and delivery was very quick ! thanks for ur services 😊

product is good    but     Worst experence from flipkart courieer executive.The executive was  unprofessional and uninformed about the exchange process of old mobile.He behaved like he came to picked up  new mobile from me.
After 1day experience camera, performance is great. Battery backup is average, heating problem only at the charging time.no heating no lagging problem. Mobile is awesome I got under 10k after exchange offer. mobile charging time too long about 3hours for full charging. quick delivery.thanks flipkart

Price 10/10,camera 8/10, battery 9/10, performance 9.5/10. Overall it is king of this price segment.
classic look.... battery back up is good.... faster processor.... solid camera. ....good if they have provided 20w charger.......
Nicely built and very fast. Compact and light weight. The display is really good and ambient light sensing is awesome. The glass backside is slippery and so need to be careful. Lots of ads in inbuilt apps. Intial camera experiences are good. No hanging issues while using camera even in 48MP-pro mode. Although i'm not a great photographer attaching some first shots.

super duper amazing....
iam facing screen flickering at low brightness and there is screen bleeding in my device.. I have checked other redmi note 7 pro. but they don't have this issue and flifcart refuse to replace my products..
camera is lagging, update required and 48mp clarity is not up to the mark. mobile automatically restart sometimes,call audio quality is good. No software issue. No heating issue. Battery back up is good- 24hrs after hard usage. speaker is good. For 13,999 currently in the market this is the best one.
Good mobile.. Touch is smooth.. I have been using realme 1. Though this mobile supports quick charge 4 the charger provided in the box is normal.. Still a good Buy.. Excellent camera.. Overall a good Buy.. Highly recommended...
best mi ph ever.... and such a beautiful camera...❤️❤️❤️
product is very nice except the speaker(earpiece for call). I m getting buzzing sound from the speaker on every calls and everytime. I complained it and the technician told me that its a bug in each device. Can anyone having the same issue???????? Please reply guys.

The earpiece is not working properly.  Whenever someone talks,  I get a radio like sound in the background.  Please help.
best of the best mobile at this price.... love u redmi
just killer
great phone in great price with great camera
I have replaced the phone two times but still i am facing MIC problem with the phone. Phone looks good and performance also nice... But the only problem is MIC, It is distracting the voice of others while on call
product awesome design but 48 mp camer taking more time to click the photo
Actually Phone is good but they are bormarding phone with Ads and installing too many Mi apps forcefully and none of them are useful.
It has a horrible performance in camera, if Xiomi cant optimize the camera bugs then this device is useless, camera stucks up while shooting the pictures, this rating is based on actual usuage of device. Xiomi should fix these bugs ASAP.
superb mobile in design and performance.
Redmi note 7 Pro # Product is really awesome

CAMERA BEAST ....guys I am not even a middle class guy (a lower middle class guy) who can't afford phone even after two years so seeing the hype of the camera I bought this phone to Meet my expectations even a little but....no that's not at all. It's compared to one plus 6T ....guys believe me it doesn't come even close to one plus 6t in camera as shown in the launch event. That was all just to create hype.... it's having eis while one plus 6t having ois so just to tell you that I don't think...
Value for money
Camera is not good as expected front camera is also very poor redmi note 6 pro camera as too better
Good and Fast delivery by filpkart.  Redmi note 7 pro is value for money. Nice camera. Good gaming performance.  Fast processor.  Sharp and clear camera.  Good optimization of battery.  Over all very good mobile at this price.
Awesome phone.. The camera is really awesome specially in night mode.. Sharing pic with you all.. Its all in low light..
my display broken when fall from 1 foot . I don't think it is Gorilla Glass 5. Very bad experience
good camera quality.....everything in this phone is good....but i think this phone's battery is draining fast...so xiaomi should put more mah battery..like around 4230mah-4500mah.....btw i like this ph
I ordered 3 Rd sale and what a phone osm
The best smartphone right now which can even put some flagship phones to shame in the camera department. Absolutely a worthy purchase & it won't disappoint you. The camera is the strongest point here. It's the best value for money device you can buy now.
best in this price range
satisfied 😍
Excellent
It is a great device , awsome screen quality , great for media consumption , performance is on top , no lag in day to day use as well as on pubg , 1 day full battery backup with heavy uses , and also takes just 1hr 35min to fully charge by a QC 3.0 Charger , Overall it the best value for money device in this price range.
Honest review...The camera is gimmick only to sell the product.Battery backup in my case doesn't even last for a complete day...48mp is the main thing in this phone on paper but after paying 14k what you get is restart the app or phone again and again as it hangs when you open the camera..Too bad product.Worst thing you can't get your money refunded and I can see many people facing the same problem with camera but the company is just busy in another flash sale instead of checking customers pr...
nice
shot on note 7pro brilliant
Absolutely mind blowing
Awsm product in 17k segment
super mobile
perfect phone... awesome camera with super design
all are good
The earpiece is pathetic, and there is a lot of distraction sound when on call. I have repeatedly checked with several sims and networks but looks like the phone has a problem. Very disappointing with the phone, how can they not test a basic function like earpiece sound.
vry very bad product display problem
camera problem, camera not working, heating problem, hanging problem. very very worst  mobile. flipkart waste . 48mp camera is just a name only when I try to open 48mp camera app crashed says restart the app so don't buy any one
redmi Note 7 Pro is awesome design display is very good but in camera mode 48  megapixel is little more improve because 48 megapixel mod is hanging problem when he capture picture
excellent...
Mobile looks Very Stylish in Design... The main Attractive thing is it's 48 MP Camera . On Performance level Snapdragon 675 One of New Processor gives better performance other than phone available in this price range. 4000 mAh battery life giving more Entertainment and gaming experience... But Screen they gives IPS LCD PANEL instead Super Amooled Display otherwise it rocks the world I will giving 4.5/5 Rating
Nice mobile with good features camera was superb,  performance is excellent, value for money..  Flipkart courier delivery person was delivered the mobile on time and good speaker too.  I bought this product last week.. Everything is going well..
I'm writing this review after 3 weeks of usage got it on 27th march flash sale. First of all i want to say camera 📷 is super-duper awesome 👍😎 Snapdragon 675 performance is really really good u can play PUBG And all heavy games without any lag on high quality graphics. Call quality is super, it have volume boost feature for noisy public places. If we talk about design.. KILLER HAI BOSS..😘❤ Full glass body gives a premium look. JUST GO FOR IT BLINDLY....😍✌👌
great camera
After 2 days of heavy usage..  1) awesome photo clarity. Mostly with back camera and then front camera is nice 2) awesome battery when used by heavy user 3) lil bit heating when used for 1 hours on full brightness 4) nice video clarity with EIS in back camera But  they shud provide EIS IN FRONT CAMERA AS WELL 5) NICE SLOW MOTION quality with 1080p at 120fps but they should give the edit option in SLOW MOTION video so that we can decide where apply slow motion effect. 6)camera hangs sometime w...
mobile getting heat but delivery boy service is good
best Product at this Price but front camera could be better.
excellent value for money
awesome all the things
excellent Camera..better than dslr just loved it 😘😘
awesome camera nd build quality is also good feels like a pro
speaker problem.  speaker not working properly.
Nice features pack phone in this price range. Camera is just superb. 48 MP in pro mode. Recved in 1st sale. Value for money. Thnxs flipkart for delivery on time in just 2 days.
It's a dud.  Expected it to live up to the hype.  Already own Note 6 Pro. Earpeace sounds so cheap. Voice you get to hear is so unnatural.  Selfie camera quality has dwindled compared to 6 Pro. Front camera ain't that great either. In nutshell,  7 Pro is absolutely skippable.
I received my redmi note 7 pro yesterday..Its camera is just awsome.Battery quality is also good.I think if you are planning to buy a mid rnge smartphone then definitely you should go for it..Its night mode is shocked me,realy it captured unbelievable images.Smooth performance.Snapdragon 675 wotks great.Thank you flipkart for delivering it to me.Its very hard to get this phone in flash sell..But I can buy it on 27 march..So happy with this phone..🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍
After a long time expressive design. 💯by redmi*(xiaomi), i am a mi fan ❤️ previously used mobile note 4 then note 6 pro. & now note 7 pro.. Worth the money 💵 ✔️📌.. No one can beat this phone at  present.#. 🚩🚩This phone is definitely *NO. 1 MID range phone of 2019. 💯💯
Camera lagging issue. software is not well optimised.
I have bought this phone on the first sale launched in flipkart. First of all,  the 48MP camera is just a hype created and nothing else.  12MP is as good as 48MP. The night mode provided here is awesome though.  Now leaving apart the camera this phone is a beast at its price.  I can play pubg in HD here which I could not in my honor 9 lite.  Performance and speed is quite good as of now.  Screen resolution is awesome.  The phone does not heat up even after continuous usage.  A drawback is a h...
everything is just awesome in this device. except the hybrid sim slot.
This is killer phone at this price point, specially the performance of the phone is jaw dropping. Camera is just awesome. Just Xiaomi needs to do some software optimization. Overall i'll strongly recommend this phone to everyone who want Beast phone in budget category.
Flipkart support is not helpful at all. The 4G signals are coming very low as compared to other phones. The technician visits and says that all is ok and does nothing. Terrible support from Flipkart and defective product from Xiaomi.
the device is good I would not say it is exactly 48MP but it has some insane features .. its ok for everyone who is looking to buy a device around 15K
super duper se uper
best phone
nice camra super
front camera is disappointing when compared to note 6 pro or poco f1, but nice design, both side gorila glass 5 protection, excellent battery, quick charge 4.0 . awesome
Camera is good. Night mod and Black mod
One of the best phone at ths price. Had lots of hurdles to get the phone booked for atleast a week . But finally mission Mi accomplished . ..
Very thing is sooo good in the phone. Only when we use the camera for longer time or watch anything for longer time. it heats. Rest evrythng is perfect. Getting such a beautiful phone in this price charge is unbelievable. The glass finish on the back is too attractive. Luckily, I got this phone on first sale and loved evry bit of it. In love with it.
I would've given 5 stars in the first week of usage of this phone but slowly all the problems stated creeping in. Firstly the camera app. It just keeps crashing even after the update and while taking selfies, the camera app shows everything frame by frame, it's that slow! Secondly the performance. It lags so much while opening and closing apps even redmi note 5 Pro was better in terms of camera and performance. I'm just hoping xiaomi will rectify this in upcoming updates. Also there are batte...
Camera quality is excellent .
beast camera,  long battery backup, rigid design  and superb processor.  fast charging without heating problem and amazing display.  best phone for money value
Quality , outdoor visibility  of Display is good. SD 675 performance is best in 15k category .RAM management & MIUI on top of the android pie is good. Selfie camera is above average & Rear camera is decent in 12MP & 48MP. & Night mode of camera is dope!!!
I am using this phone for 2 days only, but it already impress me so much..with the performance in gaming like pubg sndr 675 nailed it.. i dont know why people find no difference in 12 mp and 48 mp pics but 48mp pics are far better in detailing, believe me i have dslr and i know the difference.. there is no crackling sound in earpiece in my device , no screen bleeding ,, no camera hanging problem. and the phone is not bulky at all... Speaker produce enough sound.. and dont worry about adds in ...
Good product
Phone is great. Only durability is the issue. Since frame is plastics & its sandwich between Gorilla Glass 5.
great product
Note 7 Pro Is really capture good images.
very nice phone I love it, but ear piece volume very low and sound quality is very bad.
good
value for money. 48mp camera image takes more time. very slight difference in 12 mp and 48 mp images ...only image size difference. no EIS in 4K recording. battery is ok. no fast charger in the Box but phone supports fast charging you can buy fast charger from market.
I like the product but please don't buy the black colour it's totally finger print magnet
Got #1 sale lucky one very much appreciated and awaited smartphone
Value For Money
outstanding..,
speaker sound like cracking.
is this handset having hanging and freezing problem also having one more issue with battery that its take more time to charge the phone and battery backup is not good also and look is well,  camera also average.
Awesome
Nice service of flipkart thanks.lets talk about the phone.lookwise good. 48MP camera is just marketing strategy where it's take pics like 12MP.Cant compete with Note 5 pro camera. In low light take good pics.Sometimes camera lagg. Display quality is good. they don't provide quick charge. battery life is good not a better. sound good. now finaly only the reason for I bought this phone. For the game. gaming experience is awsome. best graphic and processor. overall phone is good but don't buy if...
best phone in this price segment
poor aftersales services and i also got some problem with device and that is earpiece is not working prpblem it has some disturbances. i m extremely disappointed
Awesome mobile
perfect mobile phone for Camera.....Ultimate in photo shoot
it's camera is soo much lagging that it does not start we have to restart the phone,if we want to click 2 pics as soon as possible we have to wait for approximately  3-4 seconds
Unhappy because of camera bulge and nothing is special with 48MP camera. If we use 48MP mode then we have to wait 15 sec to process the image. Without providing fast charger what is the use quick charge feature. This means company supporting 3rd party intervention. Suppose if I use any other brand quick charger and if any issue raises then they'll simply void warranty by pointing the use of other brand charger. Finally company provides soft case but no use because that won't protect camera.
the device heats up . 38 degrees without any games or camera usage.
mobile doesn't work perfectly
No words to explain this beast
Awsm....
Camera is overated. Not better than any 12 mp. Also, miui is pain in the donkey
I just get it today. It's feel like a killer phone. Nice all around, spacaily camera is too good.
thank you xiaomi... as well flipkart also for fast delivery....
Nice product never expect the quality.. feel like premium mobile in hand.  Speaker problem after new update it's now working fine
This Mobile is Really Awesome! Thanks to Xiaomi. Camera is incredible. I'hv fallen in love...
Battery problems  without net use. And some times Mobile not operate... Some times microphone properly not work... More heat ..... My mobile redmi note 7pro...some times face unlocking not properly use....
Everything is good in mobile but i am not satisfied with flipkart exchange policy. They want new one mobile in exchange.
awesome phone .. design also very good
I am using it from past 3 weeks.  Performance is very good.   No heating issue.  Camera superb
camra performence is very low. camera error is occuring at the time of capturing images on 48mp camera
everything is good expect MIUI o didn't like user interface. but over all nice value for money.
camera is lagging and asking to restart the device
Osm mobile
still it has to be improve
very nice..
Don't buy thise phone..  Camera 48 P  not working. And no return option onely change set.
camera lags very badly out of the box without even installing any apps ,also being crashed many times ,xiaomi should fix tje issue,is any one facing same issue.
camera is good at this budget..but the camera module protrudes from back of the phone very much..I have tried some thick cases but camera bump is huge.when you keep phone flat in any surface the phone rests on its camera..so if you buy it , keep it safe..
phone looks good but camera is not adequate. performance is ok as per new phone but camera seems dull. very bad experience
very nice phone
Amazing mobile worth of every buck
#48 mega pixel camera is works best in day light, phone is very smooth, no lags & simply beautiful Phone.
phone speaker is very poor and phetatic voice is not clear.
Not good phone.. Network strength is low.. Speaker quality is bad.. Company is not resolving problem.. Bad phone.. Advice not to buy this phone.. Unsatisfied with phone and company reply
great camera phone in lower price
nice mobile
Good
great phone,  feels good in hand and amazing performance overall.  5/5 in value for money.
Great
looking so nice but i think front camera 13 no satisfy 25 MP
one of the best mobile in below 20k.everything is perfect. an absolute alrounder.
Highly recommended...premium look..this phone is i mean outstanding with this price segment...if u r in dilemma between realme3pro and redmi7pro plz go with 7 pro..u ll not regret buying this phone!!!!
awosome phone quality
heats a lot
No competitor in the market for this product
excellent camera 😍
Guys, if you are planning to buy Nebula Red variant then please beware that it is actually PINK and Not Red! They don't take it back later hence better not book it if you don't like Pink.
Awesome #redminote7pro 😍😍😍
good
delivery boy are very good and nice
This was one of the best phone purchases recently. Though realme is giving a tough competition but this one is top notch. (I own realme U1 too). Display is very good in this price point. Camera is much better than all the phones I owned till now. (I had 2 flagship phones till date. Yet realme also comes near to it in camera). Battery performance is very good and USB type C and quick charging is icing on the cake.
Top class mobile under 20k.. go for it with cool mind..
Software need to huge improvement at all camera quality is worst nlno one is happy with revert from Samsung phones but in other devices camera quality is favolous
AWSOME PHOTOS BY RN 7 PRO
fantabulous product and super fast delivery...
best phone ever
Nothing to say about this phone. Everyone knows that who this phone is specially made for camera but overall is so fantastic performance and also battery backup. I love this phone and it's picture quality was so detailed information about the photo. I strongly recommended to all those smartphone lovers get it and enjoy. This price is so affordable.
Outstanding product at this range. everything looks cool.. battery is good... fast charging.. camera is beast in this range.. and for pubg lovers.. HD GRAPHICS, without lag... everthing load in game without any lag.. you will love it.
Very useful Brand
Super 7 pro😘😘😘
nice phone ever

Best mobile in best price I love it.....
value for money, best camera, best battery, killer performance.
Bluetooth devices are not connecting to samsung headsets,  48mp camera is very slow.
the camera 📷 is assum And night mode is good 48mp is also good  .. phone is assum so I suggest that phone
u cant more in this price segment.. perfect blend of everything.. fast processor. good battery backup. android pie.. 48 mp camera.. nd must more.. .. just go for it
Osmmmmmm mobile phone
very nice phone
Awesome handset, Perfect for daily driver..
in this phone processor is 675 and on note 5 there was 636 processer but still note 5 is faster than note 7 i m not happy with performance
Redmi note 7 pro is actually a pro. I have upgraded my self from redmi note 4 to redmi note 6 pro but when redmi note 7 pro launched in just want to grab that, lucky to have on 3rd sale. camera superb, revealing of new processor, Corning gorilla Glass, lovely design, didn't find any issue like screen bleeding or camera lag, go for it guys you won't regret.
nice mobile
good product
camera ok but processor speed I have some doubt and sound quality below average overall phone performance good about my half day observation
I used it only 03 days then sold due to found heating up easily while using internet from back below camera.
great
Awesome phone in this price. Earlier the bugs were there but on the update, they are fixed. Must buy it.
Fantastic phone in mid range.

Service was superb by Filpkart.I got My Redmi Note 7 Pro on time. in 2 day i got network issue in my mobile than i contact to Costume care and they send me replacement for my mobile in quick time . ty
smoothly use, camera extradinary.
impressed with the quality image.
Good product. In this price
best phone in this price super camera quality... thanks flipkart👌👌
everything is best but their is some fault in camera..the phone automatically hangs while turning the camera on.
at first its hanging but after update its good...
unbelievable.
certainly this one is value for money, I got two updates so far, I think heating issue has been resolved, I feel less heat now, display is good,no regrets for not going with amoled display of Samsung mobiles, performance is very smooth, camera also very good in this price range, my advice is don't be excited very much about this mobile, If you don't get in the flash sale don't worry you may get little more better device than this in coming months, if you get one you will not regret rather.
A true Value for Money Phone
Awesome
Super
best phone in this price segment ...only miui adds are disturbing
Awesome mobile go for it.
it is nice product no comparison for any device in price nice a performance and camera nice battery always mi phone better good nice Snapdragon 675 new version update MIUI 10.2.7.0 night mode picture all best
photo is good. & Excellent. but flipkart is get extra mobile protection is get not good.
vallu for money,best mobile phone
its all good. I have no idea how but on second day there is a scratch in middle of screen. They claim it to be super strong, doesn't seems so.
super nice
best mobile in under 15k, small camera issues in mobile i think next update is ratify redmi
superb phone but the battery is draing out very fast
Very nice performance and good looking phone. Its camera quality also good. Overall it is a very good phone under this price range.
It's very great full mobile
Good Phone for MI lover. Nice camera at this price range . Overall good
Everything is great with this budget but I am getting very bad noise from earpiece speaker.
xiomi is awesome.  The product is too good at this price range.
camera Beast... powerfull processor and best optimizing battery drain thats enhances battery life.
awesome and unexpected features
excellent budget killer
Awesome Camera 48M + 5M No Need DSLR. 😜
one of the best 2019 powerful performance value for money
camera not as expected....
Average
The best phone with value for money..
Nice Phone
it's all-rounder....great value for money.... descent looks 😉
Best mobile under 14k worth for money. But still they can improve it with inbuilt finger print sensor with 15k.
very nice mobile
super phone
Awesome phone
camera quality is below.. dont expect on 48 mp.. normal 12 mp Photos are good.. while talking phone low voice is there and need high volume.. my negatives camera and voice... otherwise all are good and value for money..blue colour best
camera not clear 48MP
budget cracking mobile but camera sucks on 48 mp mode it tends to slow not expected like this, another issue is battery drains quick on playing pubg... sometime phone lags.. Xiaomi should release an update to fix this issues otherwise phone is good 👍😇
Device Is Super.. And Camera Is Working Awesome But There Are Minor Lags And Bugs In Camera UI.. So It's A Great Value For Money.. Device.. The Performance And Gaming Is Just Mind Blowing..
Let's talk software first.                                                      It comes with miui 10 on top of android pie. This ui is feature packed with a lot of things that you won't find on stock android. And then there's the ad situation but there is a workaround to that and I would recommend you to turn off recommendations in each app manually.                                                                   Camera- The best in this segment.                                     This ph...
battery backup is good but not upto mark drain quickly at night but maybe i got the defected device....camera performance in daylight is awesome nd night shots are cool with flash.... performance is nice when doin regular chores but shows lags during games like PUBG....if u wanna play heavy game opt for higher RAM variant...
i got a faulty product...and not replaced... but refunded the amount.
not is good low poor quality do not purchase friend
48 megapixel camera very hang to click photo
Dont think it is 48 mp like dslr camera....  There is no detail in 48 mp camera picture like DSLR camera...  But in this price segment it is best.....
overall set specification are very good but front camera not so good. ram management is very poor. display is good.
unexpected camera performance.
Best in price segment
camera is ok ok not well
very nice product is camera is amazing thanks redmi & Flipkart
good
amazing
excellent redmi mobile 😘
Very very nice product camera its adorable every think is gud
having issue with phone mic
usually I don't like Chinese products but when I see oppo printed on jersey of Indian cricket team and vivo ipl promoted by Indian government, then I ignored that dislike and say nice nice product.
A perfect Chinese mobile phone with good features and cheap price. I will recommend Samsung Galaxy A50 or M30 instead of Redmi note 7 pro.
great phone
when you click with 48MP..It's slow down.worst phone ever seen by MI.
best smartphone in this price range.... 😘😘😘😘😘
Redmi Note 7 pro is the worst of all Redmi series. I have been using both Redmi note 5 pro and also bought Redmi note 6 pro on the first day itself. The battery performance is worst and the camera(Front) quality is a big disappointment. Let me start with battery. I will compare it with Redmi note 6 Pro. Redmi note 6 pro minimum temperature even in this summer is 25 degrees and max of 32 degrees with background running apps. on the other hand, Redmi note 7 pro minimum temperature starts with 3...
3rd grade product... Earpiece problem, Camera software problem, Battery draining very fast if i kept standby for 1 hour it consumes 5 to 8% percentage Battery. 2 times i upgraded software. and did resetting handset.. but still all problems are same. Don't Buy Note 7 Pro. Go for Note 5 Pro(6gb/64gb).
one problem in Redmi note 7 pro "find device closed unexpectedly" do note by this phone
Super phone... great price...
Slippery glass body, heating issues, software glitches, poor front camera.
speaker quality is very very poor...when we are using headphone than voice is clear...otherwise a lot of noise therein speaker doing calling.
Awesome👏✊👍
not satisfied
every thing is good,  but I face a problem with earpiece, that produce buzz sound while on call.
front luks very irritating because of  big bazzels
phone hanging issue heat issue touch issue camera issue everything is there very worst mobile replacement policy's is 100% cheating i show the video for hanging dont accept waste of my 14000 money
Why the hell my return request is being rejected so many times after receiving damaged product.  The ear piece of the device is improperly fixed and a green line appears and disappears many a times at the right edge of the phone leaving my screen hang for a few mins .  Why should one suffer with damaged product when he paid the full sum of money for it.  Strict action should be taken as soon as possible I want a fresh product instead of this damaged peice.
nice phone  osm camera
It is a paisa vasool device. Redmi once again prove that no one can beat them. In Rs. 14,000/- if you get this device, then what else you want? I love Redmi Note 7 Pro. I have used Redmi Note 5 Pro, Redmi Note 6 Pro and now using Redmi note 7 Pro. Day by day the quality of the camera, processor etc. are increasing.
My first day with this phone and I'm loving it.  The packaging was done very well, delivery was quick.  The specs of this phone is just mind boggling.  Value for money.
The camera is too laag use 48mp. I think 6Gb version is better than 4gb. Thanks
No doubt, handset is powerful in this price range with great camera but i will not recommend any one to buy this because of its Chinese origin.
redmi note 7 pro have manufacturer defect, speaker is not work well
awesome camera very beautiful I am happy
Good product
screen broke within 10 days.
awesome phone at the price range of 13999 impressive camera nice battery life
just awesome but now wait for realme 3pro for camera and performance with fast charging inbuilt charger.
super phone and camera great picture quality
Phone is very good. I found it in a sell. Camera is not so good as expected.
nice cam..... wanna improve some fixes for48 mp..... performance is gud... battery also gud
amazing camera📷 & also bettry
Please improve the performance of the CAMERA. I bought this phone for CAMERA ONLY. BUT DISAPPOINTED. It got stuck/hang while taking continues photos. It happening continuesly. Please fix this camera issue at the earliest. Thanks in advance.
Best budget smartphone ☺️ value for money
Worst phone i ever had...lags a lot... proximity sensor is not working properly...during a call, phone's screen automatically turns on and that results in opening random apps...not gonnna buy mi again.
Volume of speaker is too low plz solve this
Overall this is phone is a beast in this price segment, the only problem is with the fast charging, it takes normal time to charge (2 hours). Camera quality is excellent. Satisfied with the product.
super quality camera value for money nice finishing looks like iPhone x
Very good phone for the price range! but 48 MP is only a gimmick not impressive as Nokia Lumia 1050. Rest of the things are best in the category. Definately worth a Try!
not awesome but good  phone
The best one in this range... no one can stand in 15 to 20 k
Simply awesome
Camera is not 48 MP
Value to money , We have compared camera , vdo quality , Face unlock every thing is in line with one +6T with more than half of the prize  . Must buy . lovely device _):

Nice phone but cannot apply face lock on apps please upgrade fastly. Sensor is fast camera is owsm but the problem is that camera pic space is too hight it's all most about 14 to 20 mb per photo even it's not clicked in pro mode. this quality is tremandus .

best midrange phone
A Good looking budget phone with good camera & the gaming performance is also good. you can play PUBG smoothly . Display quality is not so good as new Samsung's phone launch .but the average quality is much better then Samsung. Don't think twice just go for it.
This mobile has a serious problem.  Several of users including me are facing slow net connection speed using mobile data (take any sim, Jio, idea, Airtel). This has been widely reported since its release but Xiomi has refused to acknowledge the problem at their end. This is happening since note 7 pro is not compatible with 4G+ in India.  Flipkart doesn't acknowledge this as a problem, and my return is refused. Think twice before buying this phone. I am unfortunately stuck with it. Camera or s...
Product was broken
Getting this phone in today's competitive digital market where every company and brands are pushing their absolute best devices at such aggressive prices is a relief if not an achievement. Was skeptical of Redmi phones are hearing "so-so" reviews but the specs and the camera definitely got my attention. Decided to get this after much thorough research and chiding on other devices, tricky luck to get it in a flash sale. But life has been sailing smooth since this has arrived. A1 in performance...
Not good work hanging problems
nice
awesome phone in budget range. Really very good and smooth experience phone as compared to other phone.
48mp camera mode really works good and does not heat up playing games,C type charging port is an added advantage for quick transfer of datas,quick charge 3.0 supported
Xiaomi never leaves a chance to surprise u with its product. Its simply amazing and camera is so good. Thanks to flipkart for quick delivery. This is a power packed phone.

The phone is awesome..except the camera.The camera is laggy as hell.And 48mp mode have to be improve.The camera bump is very big,free case is most awkward,Give no protection on camera bump,I'm using it for 2 days and the camera getting slightly scratch.The battery backup have to improve.Fix this software issues and the this will be the best phone.
Amazing phone in 14k

Purchased this beast after long time of waiting, but worth every penny of it's price. Nothing can beat it at it's price. Most powerful midrange processor sd675, best in class cameras, most premium build quality, great battery life, everything is amazing. PUBG runs smoothly on hd settings, even it's one of the first device to run fortnite at this price range. Loved this product.
Absolutely tremendous..  Phone of the year 👌

Great phone. I don't think there is any competition for this phone at this price range. Good performance and gaming speed is awesome. Redmi has changed the smartphone world. Anyone can afford a high performance smartphone at an affordable price. Well done Xiomi and Flipkart.

Everything is gr8.. but slightly not satisfied with camera performance during low light.. in daytime its gr8.. and also there is no official Gcam available at the time.. maybe later if it is available.. then I think camera would do a better job..
Flipkart delivery Speed insane..note 7 pro is good phone....it is al rounder.. except in chrging speed and gpu is not good realme 3 pro...and also lagging in asphalt 9 gaming...good for pubg lvrs

It's an elite phone within this price range..  picture quality is really nice without using 48 MP..  battery,  display and camera..  all are awesome. However sound quality need to improve..  While calling speaker sound is very low.. Overall the phone is amazing in this price range..

New Leap in Mobile Industry...
the mobile phone is excellent value for money, build quality, camera, display everything is on point. it's just the video making is having some kind of trouble due to frame drops but i hope redmi will fix this issue with software update. otherwise I'm extremely satisfied with the Mobile photo.
I liked the Camera and Speed Is too Good as it is new also I liked and I loved to use this..
Awesome
One of the best mobile tilli date by Redmi!!  Highly recommend!!
fabulous phone in under 20000 ..buy it without thinking..
This Redmi is the best Redmi.
The cellphone is, quite good in terms of quality and screen colors are vibrant and looks good however the margins are still not perfect and the chin is too big.  overall value for money
osm phone 😘love that design,  camera , performance.
fabulous
internet very slow
everything's good and organized. Thanks Xiomi for the phone
Nice mobile phone
As usual, no words to describe about fast delivery and nice packing of Flipkart. The phone is undoubtedly elegant and feature packed beast which is also value for money and highly reccomended buy in the budget segment. I personally don't like Red colour. But this gradient finish is not just a red, but a combo of purple, pink and light red what Xiaomi calls as NEBULA RED...the most attractive among the 3 available colour varients.
good
awesome camera and fully loaded battery and also the killer performer
camera is good
aswm Image Quality ❤️❤️❤️
Very poor about ordrr
bad
excellent
awesome phone
Osm mobile best performance.
I dont like MIUI, it makes the phone slower.  storage speed is too poor.
i have wasted my Money
REDMI 7PRO IS A FEBOULES  PRODUCT OF XIAOMI. I FEELS SO LUCKY WHEN I OPEN THE BOX & PICKED UP THE MOBILE IN MY HAND. THANKS TO MAKE IT AWESOME MOBLE.
good camera quality
Camera app is bit slow and no slow motion recording. Battery is great , performance is good . Face detection works well but not secure.
Good
Redmi Note 7 pro  mobile phone is to oooooooo good. and awesome
Mk
it'd have been more better if front camera wasn't reduced from 20 MP
Very good phone in this price..
extraordinary ..... mind blowing and beleiveble ....... 😍😘 gud mobile .......
very good
very nice Amazing phone
Night shot is amazing features of redmi note 7 pro.
Its just awesome phone...camera is a beast
Review after using for last one week.. It has all the features which every smart phone needed. Camera might be 48MP but it won't be that crystal clear, you can observe the blur when you zoom in.. display is not that good.. speakers are just fine.. battery back up was good it lasts 2 days without pubg and with hard usage.. So finally it is ok ok mobile but when considering price you won't get better mobile than this.. if you have price restrictions and need a good mobile blindly go for it..
osm picture quality
Phone is getting switched off repeatedly after 20 days usage
Awesome phone in this price range.
Delivery hurts when you get the phone in 5 days.Not good delivery like E Cart.. Overall Phone is looking amazing.. Hope for the best.. Stay tuned for another comment after few days of use. Thx
like DSLR photography 😍.. thanks Xiaomi..also Flipkart
camera is wow
Nice phone but 42 mp is only gimmick
good
Just one word ' gadar '
This summer:  The ultimate power, the beast-> Redmi note 7 pro
best in class
NYC phone at this price
Very nice Product  and osm  looking
I finally got the RMN 7 Pro device using a third party app for placing the order. This ph has premium build quality with gorilla glass 5 in front & back. Battery, display, Cameras are superb. Performance of SD 675 top- notch👌. Realme 3 Pro can't beat RMN 7 Pro with an ordinary polycarbonate plastic back design. You can't consider Realme 3 pro as premium as RMN 7 Pro. Redmi is the best & king of smartphones. Just go for it guys blindly.
Very Nice Mobile in budget.
Ya it's very cheap and good to use and it's a classic phone
Wow Classic from mi

Good camera quality, good battery backup
useless product dont buy
A screen defective phone got from Flipkart and given for replacement . They not accept replacement request after there visit of technical person and found defective. Replacement is rejected after visit. They told this  camara & screen is defective is commen. If anyone going to buy this product it will be your risk, because if they don't replace or return cash if u get a defective product.  They try to fool u till return policy time ends
It's very Good really amazing mobile value of money this product  good mobile but front camera is to very bad not zoom and zoom out
best phone in this praise love u mi

good
awesome products specially in this range
Great product at this price. It would have been better if Xiaomi provided fast charger in the box. Delivery from flipkart was great. Delivered here in Silchar(town in Assam) within 3 days.
I have received mobile just in three days.  Thanks to flip kart for this fast delivery. Mobile is working fine,  I found no issue with mobile. No screen flickering,  No speaker issue during calling,  No battery drainage issue,  No camera UI issue. Soon Xiomi will provide update to support Fortnight.  I am happy with this phone.
after few days ram is filling above 80% and 25gb was taken by system and it's starting hang and battery was drain within 5hours without using
My first and best phone smooth performance and good device by xiomi i love it must buy and enjoy
superb phone
dont buy  on flipkart
my phone display low brightness then Flickring display
I am waiting for next sale.... Don't think much more go for it blindly.
Review after almost one month use.... a perfect phone for a youngster pocket
Best one you cant get in this price range. Stylish and best performance smartphone. Also good battery backup. Overall totally satisfied with what Xiaomi is providing with this product. Being using Redmi note 4g, Redmi note 3, Redmi note 5 pro and now this one all thanks to the Xiaomi India for providing such smartphones in aggressive pricing.
i am using this phone since one month. the phone is really a good phone.valuable for money. camera is awesome.
Truly an world class device.
Best value for money under 14k....
Believe me guyz you can't get any phone at this price not even realme 3 pro can beat this.Everything is good and no issues found till now.one thing i like the most is the hand feeling of this phone.it feels like holding a flagship Go for it as it is giving more than what you are spending
overall good.. its just 1 day I am using.. lets just hope for the best..
Very good
Awesome pics and everything will be there
Osam mobile with this price range.. Very gud software but camera bump is very much outside from mobile body.. Overall nice quality
Mind blowing product.
Only one issue about the low voice of receiver. I hope it will be resolve soon. Overall awesome handset in this price range.
I love this product thank you Flipkart & MI India
Good product and performance is super
nice look this mobile
Great product
too much heating
super for good phone charger very good day pilp karat redmi note 7pro
Good budget Smartphone which has everything but not every phone is perfect. Here are its Pros 1. Good Battery Life 2. Good Design 3. Good User Interface 4. Periodic Updates. CONS :  Biggest CON is despite it's having Gorilla Glass 5 it still prone to scratches even small scratches. Check screenshot as I have used this phone for 10 days now. Camera is laggy sometimes.
Top in this budget.
Spectacular camera phone with full support of camera2api so Gcam can be installed without rooting.  I would suggest everyone to install Google camera as stock camera is not upto the mark as Gcam.
I would like to buy Flipkart protection..I forgot to add while purchasing mobile..and I couldn't add due to time issue..I think there should be option to add protection after purchasing mobile.
Best smartphone in budget segment Camera performance is amazing but you can improve that buy installing Google camera you can also click RAW format images with it one of the biggest issue of this phone is Advertisement in app and UI but thoose advertisement can be removed completely by disabling recommendations from each system app and setting
Light weight, speed performance, good camera, But Mobile and charger heats while charging as like all Xiaomi phones.
Awesome phone.. very stylish.. must buy phone under 15k.
The Phone feels very small like on hands still  being 6.3 inches
Best Camera Phone 2019
value for money ( 4 gb +64gb) ,  nyc & smooth smartphone... no heating issue in approx one month and I think no heating issue in future and also most perfect with  Mi (security patch updated March month)  every 3 to 4 month update coming......
those are the pictures captured by redmi note 7 pro ,awesome,good design and performence overall a great packege in my opinion.
Only thing i felt is.. Battery is weak wen compared to other Mi phones. It drains quite fast wen it in auto mode.
I was having Redmi note 4 before Redmi note 4 but I haven't noticed any extraordinary change I comparison with Note4 the only two things are supervisor in this model   and those things are 1. notch display and 2. The 48 MP camera with AI that's it...
beautiful one...
Excellent night photography... Battery not too good.... Some bugs found...
I bought this mobile few days back and within 15days my proximity sensor stopped to work.  and I am facing a worst problem whenever I am on call.  within 15 day,  my mobile have to visit service center and having operation of it.
Good phone with nice display. Camera is very good and thumbs up for night mode, battery back up is good. I am not into games, and not facing any heating issues.  Only thing the camera is projected out from the phone body and you may have to take care of it, while handling the phone. Overall good value for money phone.
Bezels could have more thinner. Everything is good👍 battery life is exceptional
I am just totally in love with the camera. I never expected such great performance at such a low price. This phone gives Entry Flagship level performance at a Mid range level price.
camera lag.... go for realme 3 pro
Quality smartphone. Great specifications and having excellent build quality with type-C port fast charging but disappointing point is that redmi not provided fast charger out of the box. total a value for money product at budget. must buy smartphone.
Redmi note 7pro is a very best mobile with this price rang....no one any mobile compite with it.....no 1indian smart phone and i love it.
Some times speaker not working properly.
awesome device nothing to beat in this range. playing pubg in high graphics
just irritated with ads....
EXL phone
Yet another awesome product by Redmi. Perfect in all aspects and undoubtedly best mid range phone in the market at present. Keep up the good work Xiaomi.
best phone ever !!
as per given 48 mega pixel camera not good results
i not recived this mobile
camera hanging and also noise issue
Charger adaptor is defective, is that replaceable or not?
great features.. but night mode performance is not good
It is hanging
This is an excellent all rounder mobile but I am so much disappointed with the camera. Its not that much good. The image clicked are little bit dark. Skin tone looks so darkish in 48 mp camera but selfie camera is ok. 48 mp camera is not living upto the expectations. Disappointed with camera.
With wonderful 48mp 📷  it gives us an excellent battery backup with high technology sd 675 processor.But something is bad that it takes much time to process the 48mp photos(almost 3-4s) & sometimes its hang for a couple of minutes when u click photos in pro mode. Its have the latest (2019-03-01) security patch level. Whatever it is an excellent nd balanced phone in this price.
not happy
There is quite a bit of lag and may be rectified with the software update. Camera seems to be okish not that great. Day to day performance seems to be fine. Software Optimisation seems to be the only problem. Else its bang for a buck.
bad experience
Camera is lagging,  Network reception is bad
Redmi note7 pro is realy good, and excellent performance while using pubg
Not good camera get hang
it's photo quality is excellent but only battery performance is not that much good.
CAMERA BROCKEN AUTOMETICALY
am not impressed  this model ...camera is not good 12 mp camera 😐😤👎

I felt the network reception quality is a bit weak in this smartphone other than that everything is  good..the camera is good , battery life is really good for a 4000mah battery, display quality is good...this is a value for money smartphone
very good prodect but 48mp camera is not at all good
Mobile Network Issues. Sometimes it automatically disconnect from mobile data even when mobile network is proper.
Awesome product by MI..Nice performance..
Nice mobile..! but Flipkart delivery is very bad
wifi problem.  could not able to connect to laptop.  need to replace.  not satisfied with the product.
super phone under 15 k
It is good mobile. but why 6gb is not available and if it is not available also on flipkart page it is showing.
Good Priced & better product.
every single thing is best..except for that 48mp camera...it should be pre loaded and also images gets pixilated when zoomed..in small distances...
redmi note 7 pro is good compared to vivo v9 pro.
awesome phone
not good this device
Fornt camera quality is vera bad. Poor
Great Performance And Quality Camera is the main Reasons why I am choosing Redmi Note 7 Pro..... Awesome MIUI .... Android Pie 9.0 , USB Quick Charge 4.0 is the best specification of this phone....Go For It...Thanks Flipkart fir timely delivery
Rear camera is above average but front camera is not up to mark. Rest is worth for money.
very nice phone
Thank you so much for quick delivery. The phone is superb it gives me a chance to give best gift to my wife...
Awesome great
camera is good but not at 48MP,  it's a Ford statement..
my phone keeps hanging up while i get incoming calls
Nice handset ,nice camera,good dlvry
it is a best phone in amount.... nd best camera
Nice
Battery backup low
this phone gets heat up while taking videos for just 2 mintues. do not waste money
Awesome Delivery from flipkart.... I observed Some of Negative Comment about its 48MP Camera, if the pic taken on 48MP mode then the camera app getting Crashed;, But Personally I cam tell none of the problems I never faced on 48MP Mode, Great Camera, Great Phone .. Thank You SuperConnect as well thank you MI &Flipkart
Heavy mobile, Camera functioning is slow, camera is k, but overall k phon.
very bad mobile don't purchase
The phone is good but sometimes it takes a little time to process, mainly in the case of camera when you use 48 megapixel. Also the display could be complete screen but the phone has boundaries which makes it not exactly a complete screen phone.
Headset Jack is not working.
Awesome phone with awesome price...
battery goes so fast
Good Mobile
Not worth it ! No improvement over last 1.5 - 2 years!
If u r are person who use phone for talking purpose then this is not a right choice becoz the ear piece is poor but u r are gamer then this is a smart choice
Osm smartphone ❤
nice mobile
automatic switch off 3 tymes
not good at all
IT IS GOOD DEVICE BUT THERE IS LAG IN IT WHENEVER YOU START THE PHONE FROM SLEEP MODE
i am note happy
portrait mode is a awesome
Camera Quality is good. But little bit lagging after capturing 48 mega pixels shoot. Screen resolution is very good but I think touches is not up to the mark. Overall performance is above average.
good smartphone this price,but front camera not good compear to Mi A2
Good budget phone
nice mobile
outstanding Mobile
plz include AMOLED in next gen MI Redmi Phones too
mobile phone IS awsome but flash sale is bad
worst
Superb Phone But only camera issues 48 mp shot need 1-4 sec to save and it has shutter lag while recording video if the phone is warm and the phone heats up fast while using camera
excellent superb
very poor design
Very worst phone I ever seen before. The phone will auto reboot or find system closed unexpectedly.the 48 mp camera will not work in my phone. If I changed 48mp and take photo it will processing for save but not save the photo in my gallery. Very very worst if I go to face book or gmail in my phone it's shows find device closed unexpectedly
from a week iam using redmi note 7pro mobile first day of delivering a mobile i faced the lot of issues by over heating hanging and camera lagging after next day i put for replacement a product i contacted flipkart for replace the item but they have not responded properly and they even not care about customers very bad experience with flipkart
best mobile in best price I love it
This phone has a very good Camera and  long lasting battery, one thing is not great in this phone. . It has lcd display, if there is amoled display in this then this will be a perfect budget smart phone in 15k category.
Don't buy this phone..... In this phone everything works great.......but the network issue is up to top level......I bought this phone in second sell.....since than...I thought... The network issue is due to service provider, but when I compared this phone with other Redmi phone like note 5 pro, note 4 .....this phone has very low connectivity.....in every other phone IPL match can   be watched live even in very poor condition but this phone unable to start live match or Youtube video, it sho...
Great phone with monstrous processor and battery life. Performance is also very impressive but 48 MP camera is slightly disappointing.
Amazing phone.......
excellent
great budget phone...  must buy..
pubg gameplay very smoothly and Snapdragon 675 processor best processor on budget phones and 48MP camera so good
it's so disgusting from flipkart i got the mobile which is lagging whenever i am using camera whether I'm using 12 mp or 48 mp my mobile is getting switch off 5-6 times by itself and when i registered complaint for replacement i didn't get any response the technician first cancel the meeting by saying that i was not available even he didn't call me and when he visited i showed him every problem even i showed the video i recorded and the screenshot as well but he mentioned that the problem has...

Value for money ....If you want best budget phone under 15k with all features ... Obviously 48mp camera under 15k... It's awesome
I had the camera preview issue customer support was very worst. They had never resolved the issue so far.
camera is hanging while taking pics, battery not upto the mark it drains quickly

Amazing phone for the price. No other phone can beat this. I love the performance of powerful sd675 processor and the all new glass body design. I forgot to mention that the camera is amazing too. Worst part is flash sale where a common user can't buy this normally. Use script or chrome extension to auto buy.

Without any issue.!
device was great I did not like the video recording of the n7pro it could be great and when I first booted the device it was very laggy and was freezing in switching between apps and the portrait photography when u click the portrait it takes time to process it and during that the phone freezes

cemra lens brack and it not availavl in local mi center . very bad cemra lens
superb value for money....
nice product thnx mi
the redmi note 7 pro ..is just Super phone. super looks and Camera quality just mind-Blowing. as u can see its 13 mp selfie camera , picture quality is really good.. its value for money phone. u can take it.
best phone in the budget segment.upgraded from Note 4.  When samsung says 'Dont teach your father how to make phones'.. Redmi says "chill grandpa.. your time is over..apna time aayega ..apna time aa gayaaa "
Great Phone. Battery doesn't support my needs. But all other features are awesome.
super mobile, but camera is not 48mp
facing network issue and front speaker issue while on call
speaker  is making buzz sound when playing songs and when dalling the ear speaker also making buzz sound.  not expected from xiomi
Awesome product
After 5 days of usage I am honestly satisfied with this device...In this price range no other device can give you this type of camera quality, performance, built quality and design and also battery is really good, it can give you easily 1 or 1.5 days battery life on moderate use.If I am telling about 48MP feature that company hyped too much then personally I think there's no big difference between 12MP normal mode and 48MP mode, the only difference in 48 MP mode is it has superzoom ability co...
more 5 phones
every thing good but when the incomeing caller voice too low
Good phone... worth money
good
camera and display very very good
good mobile at the price I loved it
back camera so good but front camera average
Excellent camera long battery life price very good
Nice phone and performance good
The camera specification of 48 mp albeit good but not the best.  When you are out on broad daylight and wish to use your phone,  you have to increase your brightness to full which reduces battery power.  Excessive usage for a longer time can cause apps to lag a bit.  Charging is faster though.
good
nice phone . value for money . overall good
Great smartphone with great camera. This smartphone is value for money and its camera is comparable to that of samsung s10 and iphone Xs Max. No screen bleeding no muffled sound in front speaker. front speaker is loud and clear and screen is mind blowing. In hand it feels really premium. Now let me share a picture that I've taken with Redmi note 7 pro and that picture would blow your mind and can be seen below.. :D
Little disappointment in terms of front camera, memory management and always with hybrid sim slot..: (
This mobile was amazing and perfect in budget phones. also the look of note7 pro was incredible.
very nyc Camera quality,48mp extra mode included,A normal pic hve a avrg of 7-8 mb, in 48mp mode an normal pic is 15-17 mb... high gaming performance.. We can play Pubg in HD at 'High' frame rate, now you people can understand... one of the best phones xiaomi released.. With a Catching Glass gradient back panel...
Good
I love Mi
takes some time for clicking photo in 48MP mode and night mode

First Nebula Red color pic in review.....  awesome look .... fall in love with this....
Awesome  with good camera and battery in this price range  but hybrid sim slot  has bee  the weak point of Redmi phones as most of their Mobiles come with hybrid sim slot.
I want to give a 5 star but I was gave 4 Star because first time I received a defected mobile and that was not charging but after replacing the mobile work perfectly.
Not good...bad experience...not worth of 48 MP Camera....
Excellent Purchase
Amazing and super fantastic phone under budget,  camera is just awesome,  performance is excellent,  must go for it 👍

After 5 days of usage everything is gud,  battery backup camera etc awesome.. But one issue I got is headphone icon got Stucked and speaker stopped working for a minute... Bad experience for headphone jack
delivery was too slow almost 6,7 days camera contains too many brilliant features. other specs u can see on internet. battery life seems to be not that much like it was said on youtube videos. The looks are better than u think specially blue colour.
what a phone nice to use it, it is like a glass phone every thing, camera performance, battery backup is owsm
nice phone
awesome phone, perphormence mind blowing.
back camera is super mobile bulid qilulity is super
Super cool!!  Software needs a bit of tweaks
Best phone this year
The Phone doesn't come with a fast charger thought the phone supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0. It literally takes 2 hours to charge 100% from 0%. Camera quality is awesome first picture on this phone made my heart meltdown. It's tough to find a back case which protects the camera as the camera lens are bumpy. I'm disappointed with flipkart as they didn't sort the problem which I faced while ordering this phone. Overall I'm happy with the product but disappointed with Flipkart's response. If...
All good but found the brightness is slightly lower than usual
OK OK......... NOT AS EXPECTED

Excellent note 7 pro

Value for money
camera ,performance,design awesome
Not so good....camera not working properly at 48mp.
Lags in pubg.. Front cam is bad.. Battery drains fast..
camera quality is poor
better to buy Samsung M30..MI is fooling with 48mp but result is zero
poor material used mobile
rear camera is just ok.. apart from dew drop notch everything is similar to Redmi note 6 pro..
battery is not so good
bad lick
heating issue
very bad dont buy this product.. camera very bad not get 48mp...
Awesome phone .....fully paisa basool ...can purchase blindly........
48 MP CAMERA NO PORTRAIT MODE
heating on pubg in 5min of play. also skipped some frame on hd settings.

Best camera & stylish smartphone made by Redmi, best phone under 15k, #I❤️MI
good camera but not real #48mp camera 📷 and may you find Lord shiv in this picture..
mobile get heated while charging and while using also....very poor product....
Phone is nice but lack of super amoled display
I had a second thoughts about buying it at first because I saw some reviews saying that the camera was laggy or that the earpiece speaker was bad. But I didn't face any of those problems. So far no problems. Very satisfied with the purchase.
I recently bought a MI redmi note 7pro on 15 march 2019, and today on 27 March 2019 While using the headphone I found that I headphone jack is not working, and when I contact MI store and Flipkart for replacement they refuse
awesome phone best product of mi superb camera
super vey nice camera
mind blowing purchase really good manufacture
48 mp camera very nice high dimand phone value of money
,10/10 best of Redmi
awsome mobile
good
no quality in camera, zero as per compare 48 mp any phone in india
48 MP only showing but no quality and camera image blurred when zoomed.
Camera lagging, not able to take continuous photos, performance is very slow, denied to replace it... very very disappointed... waste of money.. waste of time..
poor product.
camera not working and camera app full hanging problem
money Worthy...15-25 Mb images capture in 48 mp camera.. battery performance is average . overall give 5 star.
display bezel are very big
speaker nice vaipret not work touch screen still  totaly bad
camera quality ok but very slow while taking snap also hang when video recording. lots of add redmi failed my expectation first time also heating issue I feel most of the time. half of the paint was gone in the speaker so am going to return for exchange and delivery was took 5 days even I have filipcart plus
very poor build quality.. very poor cemera.. very poor display.. friends never buy it.
worst camera. don't buy
superb mobile
phone is having heating issue although i use only instagram for 30-35 min only 48 mp camera is good, but  it is for zoom only in close range 48 mp not good enough battery charging is fast and drain is also fast but atlast it will go upto 4-4.5 hours on heavy use but heating is major problem in summer you will dont think to play it for more than 2 hours.                                       👍 if you think useful
camera is very bad
not to much good as expected,  battery is not performing 24 hour and also the camera is not too much nice as I was thinking redmi note 7 pro in my side not good.....
this mobile compare to other mobile i think batter then
Awesome device. Rear camera, performance, battery backup, display quality, looks all are simply superb. Only cons are hybrid sim tray and no Quickcharger in the box. I had to buy a Qualcomm Quickcharge 3.0 charger separately @ 500 rupees.
mobile overheat
There should not be permission to xiaomi to sell redmi note 7 pro in india. A major problem in this is network problem. 4g net speed is like 2g.
camera is very bad
I am happy to buying this product in 3rd sale very nice product nice battery backup nice display quality and also Snapdragon 675 is very fast camera quality is very good finally overall best phone in this price range
COMPARE TO REAL ME note 7 pro is better phone
Display is average . Except display everything nice.
best mobile
it has not even been one month since I have purchased the phone and the headphone jack is not working
wonderful
very bad
Nice Phone with Amazing Camera . 48Mp Not Really As 48Mp . It's Look Like 16MP
one oth best till now ,  DONT LISTEN OTHERS JUST BUY IT
Camera not up to mark.... Like 48 mp
good phone
just like any typical Mi device. If you've used Mi device before there's nothing new in it. there's so much hype about the camera. there's nothing like 48 MP in it. Just gimmick. don't buy if you are looking for better camera within the phone. camera is same as other phones in this price category, nothing special. battery and performance wise it's quite ok.
best camera📷 phone
Super phone

unbelievable camera quality
well, Xiaomi has launched this phone with the greatest specification on the affordable price Rs.13999.00 and this product is excellent and give the great feeling and camera is awesome but there is just slight difference between 48 MP or 5 MP also the properties of 48 Mp is too large instead of 5 MP about 12 MB plus but the detailing is brilliant but in case of processing it is too good and you won't face any buffering, fast charging and Xiaomi also added some new feature in that to enhance th...
frnds do not buy this phone because heating issue

Good Product
awsome phone for this Price 😍😘😘😘😘
Best phone in this price range, back camera is amazing in good as well as in low light scenarios, it's front camera is average and most of the time it takes shakey photos, in low light it is even worse. You can use Google camera to improve front camera performance as the hardware of the camera is quite good.
Amazing phone
problem in phone no return and no solution
battery actually not support fast  charging ...........low battery life ..its run only 5-7 hours
Camera bump problem
awesome
Great buy! Best phone in this price range.
wow.  what a phone.. I love it..  thanks Xiomi..  Ee sala cup namde
The product is nice but there is no use of 48mp camera. 12mp is enough..Note 7 and note 7 pro have almost same ..
Fantastic Smartphone.
Great phone..crisp display.. good battery life and the 48 MP camera is icing on the cake.. way to go..
superb
nice
Osam back cemara
overall a very good phone as per price but little disappointed with the 48mp camera pictures as I don't find much difference in 12 and 48mp pictures . however. definitely recommend for the overall performance
super mobile worth for the price tag of 13999/-
The back camera at default mode itself is producing the best photos in the segment.. one of the best redmi phones ever launched in india.. go for it..
I loveeeee it . And Thank u FLIPKART.😘. FOR FAST DELIVERY.

VALUE FOR MONEY
Very bad if you give huge amount and no triple slot and not good selfie then its better to buy realme 2pro
Superb phone at an incredible price. The features are very impressive and this time Redmi has added fast charging also, which makes this phone a really good choice for those who want high specs at a justified price.
You should go for Realme 3 Pro.
battery is not good... touch is not so smart
I ordered this phoen for my father after 15 days i get to see the cam broken and it has been handled with care.no idea how it was broken.seems the cam glass is very delicate.cant return it though.

Redmi Note 7 Pro is a phone that comes in the budget range and features great camera specifications. The display is extremely crisp and sharp. Contrast and dynamic range are pretty good, and colors are punchy without being oversaturated. Great user experience.

redmi note 7 pro is a real hero under 15k.But 48Mp camera doesn't work like 48Mp ,If you are going to buy just only for it's 48Mp camera then don't buy it. otherwise it's an awesome mobile that you can buy under 15k.

Not satisfied this product
camera not at all good, picture quality is not satisfaction as they shown on launch event, note 5 pro is much better camera then note 7 pro
It doesn't have gorilla glass.
I charged the mobile to 100% and kept it idle for a night. When I checked the next day, the phone was off as the battery was dead. The replacement process is also not easy, they(flipkart executives) are trying to avoid the replacement as much as possible. First time this has happened to me after years of online shopping. Disappointed, Flipkart!
excellent
a little bit weighted due back side glasses but it's ok.....👌all thing is good.

Nice product... Camera output is amazingly wow... It capture too much detail... Performance is quite good but the battery sometimes drain quickly... The glass body looks stunning, the black is really the black beauty... But all I can say is that it is really a way much better than the Realme 3 pro in all state and within 20,000/- this is the camera beast...
it's awesome... 😍
Phone is beast for its price. fast charger isn't included in box thts only disadvantage of this phone.

Great phone at this price point, But battery drains out faster when u indulge in normal surfing, Haven't tested battery while playing games, Overall great product for this price point, Had MI preferred 5000 Mah battery, This phone would have killed the market,Anyways phone is made in India by a Chinese Company, Assume that some Indian worker would have had a hand in manufacturing this piece. 🙂
nice phone
super mobile camera 48+5 good
selfie camera not good if you are looking for selfie camera, don't buy that.display average.battery backup is good.
Redmi note 7 Pro is super phone at reasonable price offered by Mi. Awesome camera, processor, screen and services. recommended for all class people.
the phone is very good looking and best for every side
Thanks to Flipkart and delivery man...

I have  been using this phone for past 3 days couldn't have found a better product at this price range. The features are amazing touch fingerprint sensors works like magic, the camera is topnotch. the quality sharpness clarity is mind blogging and the stylish gorilla glass on both the sides have got all the eyes on it. A perfect smartphone at minimum price line. couldn't be more satisfied.

nice product, good internet modem, just camera quality lacks, some heating, fragile body and slow charging makes it a bit less value for money. But Xioami can fix some issues and it has nice hardware
camera quality is best i think at this price range . value for money no doubt.
excellent
best  under 20k phone ,2019
I just love this redmi note 7 pro picture quality is best night mode feature is love overall performance is good value for money 😍😍😍😍.  sourabh choudhari 🙂
good picture quality
Overall phone is good but I think 48 MP camera is an only marketing strategy. There is a little bit difference between 12 MP camera and 48 MP camera. So If you want to buy this phone for 48 MP camera then it's not a worthy deal. You can go for Redmi Note 7 also. Service of Flipkart for this phone is too late for me. I got in 7 days after ordered.
just awesome...!!!!
Nice camera

amazing phone by redmi
A good budget Smartphone which has everything however here I would like to mention about Gorilla Glass. I don't think it's having Gorilla Glass 5 protection as I can clearly see small Scratches on my phone despite it never fell down. I just put it in my pocket without keys or sharp edge things but still it has got small scratches which is clearly visible. I highly recommend everybody to use Tempered glass.
super product
alot of hype was created  for blue colour varient but  i think   for prolonged use, black is all time best . .  as edges are of plastic so colour gets removed  when colured varient phone falls  . telling this as i bougt    blue    so this is all i have to suggest otherwise no complaint for performance
superb 📱
Super cool Nice Look Red Colour
front camera could have been better... other wise it's an excellent phone. Love the colour of the phone (Nebula Red) n design as well.
back camera focus not working properly,  focus and capture the image for slowly

I've been using suing this phone since a while and I enjoyed it. the only problemlem that I faced was the camera is not as good as I expected. in low lights the pictures looks like plastic. I bought this phone just because of the camera however I felt noelw that that camera is not that superb if you are clicking pictures in artificial lighting.

Osm 48 camera amezing perfomence
This is again a masterstroke from Mi. After the relative failure of Note 6 (owing to its lack of hardware update), this one gets them right back on track. Leave 48mp aside, the camera at this price is perfection. The display is great and the battery, as has been in the Note series, is really powerful. I don't like the new colors but that is a personal choice, I have friends that love them. Got 14k budget for a phone, your search should stop here, ie, if you manage to get this one in one of th...

Phone was delivered in good condition.The phone was excellent as promised by xiaomi.Only problem was that the phone was not delivered to my home.I had to go to the office nearby and pick it myself.The delivery address was my home and not the parcel office.😠😠😠😠🤬

Nice mobile
Hanging problems & camera quality is not good

The Redmi note 7 pro is awesome features and it's performance quite better but screen quality is little bit dull but another all things in this budget is superb...
Nice phone and nice camera 48+5 MP in redmi note 7 pro

Amazing device @ just Rs. 14000...Look is very nice... camera is amazing.. Battery backup is very good easily one for heavy uses of mobile and for less use easily for 2 days... But charging takes much time more than 2 hours... also its lag some time so it's required to restart... overall Best device in this range....

very good product but we can't track my product

Looking at the price point,  this phone is a beast. It has a powerful 675 Soc, with 48mp (quad pixel bind technology)  which provides great depth to pictures, great build quality. Battery back up is great bcoz if it's 4000mah battery. Well glass back looks great, feels premium but accidental drops can cause damage(though protected by Corning gorilla Glass 5 on both sides). Overall a great deal. Go for it!
Fabulous
over all phone is good camera is best but battery drains fast
Mi products are known for their value for money since the introduction of their first flagship product Mi3 in India. Quality and finishing of their products are class leading; and Redmi 7 Pro is no different...Thank you Mi India.
Bakwas phone hangs alot heat up very quickly and charging taking too much time
48MP camera images are not as expected, it's like 8MP. very disappointed with the camera performance.

Everything is good in this product I am giving one less star for the bad courier service and it's technical faults .The product reached in time actually pretty much fast then I expected but there was no update on the shipment and also I was not able to track it although Flipkart customer support assured me that I will get the product before promised delivery date but I was worried and afraid also on the other hand that I will get my ordered product or not since it took very long time to order...
it's amazing. and flipkart delivery is to fast

all are boasting about this phone to be very performing phone having a good camera.  i'll say the pubg is not running smoothly in medium settins, the net connectivity is poor then my other 2 phones I have (nokia 6.1 plus and redmi note 5 pro) the low light indoor camera performance is worst. suggest to buy realme 3 pro instead
camera very good

good mobile in this price segment
Good design, impressive audio quality from the headphone jack, battery backup is excellent, for camera use it with Google camera and low light photography improves a lot, type C port is a must have feature in 2019, selfie camera is not that good, charging speed is a bit slow but I can get the Quick Chage 4 when it's available, for ads in UI you can disable it, and lastly camera bump is too much you have to get a seperate back cover as the one provided in the box is useless. Overall a great ph...
I just bought this phone for camera it's really amazing to get 48MP camera with this amount. worth for money
not worth it....camera is written 48mp but its just on paper....look wise also phone is average....there is no difference in looks as compare to old mi phones...better go for samsung A or M series.
Owsm phone

Nice back camera....front is just okk...little bit of heating issue.. build quality is good but camera bump is too high. The lens got some scratches
camera protection is very low
this phone is amazing in mid range phone
The device is just awesome but the software is not optimize there is many bugs which i am facing since date of purchase the main bug is camera error issue and then when i started video call on WhatsApp it automatically go in PIP Mode after few seconds don't know how but if these bugs are fixed then the phone will become just awesome....m

Under this price segment Redmi Note 7 Pro is definitely the best. While playing PUBG no lags were detected even on HD settings. Camera is also good but i observed that battery power is not that good comparing to my Old Redmi Note 4. Overall its a worth buying product.

More than what you expected, only one complaint about miui is that miui stock rom contains ads
Very nice im very happy
camera could be better ,why everyone is so excited, camera is slightly better than 6 pro... that's it..performance is great and battery backup too, but I still think Realme3 pro is better than this one...no sd card slot only hybrid slot still ...many aspects still need to be  better , also ads are irritating...

Camera quality and display could have been better. Though in this price segment, Redmi Note 7 Pro is almost a value for money Product.

good  phone
It has a perfect camera and budget phone. it has long battery also. but during capturing long video and continue photography it starts over heating.
Superb phone
It is a beast,  camera is extremely good and the picture quality is extremely good and crisp,  lookwise it is damn awesome and feels good in hand without cover but the camera bump is bit of an ache as you have to be careful sometime, performance is fine but sometime UI gets hang or bit unresponsive for couple of seconds,  there are minor ads in some apps especially the gallery or player app which pops up after you see videos,  rest of it is great.  it is a complete value of my money
Niccc super

Great Camera Mobile, Design is very nice but the performance is not too good..  i was expecting more..
when the battery level is too low that is less than 5% the amount of heat dissipated by phone is too high,It takes much time to capture 48MP photo and size of that photo is also too high in the range of 12-15 mb......so be cautious except that every thing is completely fine including camera........#in love with redmi note 7 pro.........A awesome mobile for middle class budget ......
camara is gud
Ok
Lighting delivery.. awesome product. Although battery consumption is high during Playing pubg.. camera is flagship grade.. really value for money.

Powerful featured phone under 15k
to be fair i was expecting a great phone after note 5 pro but this was disappointing. There is a visible lag in everything- cant say its sw or hw side. Camera captures great photos but takes a while to launch..the worst part are the speakers. There is just one speaker at the bottom while it looks like there are 2 . the sound is too low and becomes audible only after reaching the halfway point using volume buttons. also there are frequent breakdowns of the speaker in the form of a cranky robot...
camera quality good...
exelent
Very good phone at this price I really feel good in using this phone

You will not get what has been much hyped about... Camera quality is not good nor its speaker quality... Also phone heats up very quickly and sometimes lags alot especially during call it turns on to loudspeaker mode without having been touched on that function...

The processor is blazing fast & MIUI 10 is very well optimized which gives quick response. camera quality is very good and all features like portrait mode, bokeh mode etc are available except slow motion video. Sometimes heating phenomenon was observed but it was observed after extensive use of game or mobile data. Rest the mobile is excellent choice for anyone who want speed, response & camera qual...

A budget phone  which comes with a 48 mp camera which may sound wow but actually isn't, because it captures the pictures from 12 mp camera only,  also in comparison to other phones of same range it is a great deal but frankly I'm not satisfied with the camera battery life is good and also it doesn't comes with a fast charger, if you want it you have to buy it separately so, camera not so good as said but still a good phone in the budget phones.
Good feature

osm phn...
Best smartphone i purchased till now.    Screen quality, speakers loudness is awesome. Miui is user friendly. Camera quality is best, only little laggy. Hope upcoming updates will fix this issue. Best smartphone.
nice look & design that phone. but camera to buggy software , not support well when we started 48 MP (should be clear in next software update) . value of money phone in that range.
Nice phone , but, Camera is lagging in portrait and pro mode. Rest is all fine till now.
value for money, excellent camera
Nice
Very good phone, but battery and volume level of sound could be better.
all thing are better.  but front camera better in day light and artificial light than note 5pro but in very low light front camera is little weak note 5pro. yet.  note 7pro best phone
THE BEST smartphone under 15k budget.. nothing more is needed to say..
value for money
superb phone
SUPERB PHONE AWESOME EXPERIANCE OVERALL
The display is very low light. Sound is very less. And when u ll b in call the sensor misbehaving and making d display on off on off causing call hold and disconnect.
Awesome
display ,bettery good camera also good but it's hang when activating 48 MP Camera 😔😔😔😔
Awesome
camera not as expected
best mobile in 13999 rupees
good product at reasonable price. lot of mi bloatware though which could be irritating at times. night camera is great. you dont really need to use the 48 mp pro camera unless you want more detailed pictures (which take lot of storage around 13 mb per pic). The default camera mode is great. phone heats up a little when you play games for a long time. battery lasts for 1 day atleast with average use.
good
The device was great but the front facing camera isn't upto the mark.
No words to explain, the quality in this price range is just superb.
Good phone at that price
Overall a good package by xiaomi.
Too many ads.  Feels unsafe to use.

realy good but difficult to place order
Not satisfied with the 48 mp camera.highly saturated photo.Not satisfied at all.Samsung lover can't be satisfied by Redmi phone.
Quite a good phone, speed is decent, could be more as it uses snapdragon 675, camera is very very good, face unlock a bit slow, and Playing videos on YouTube or Instagram makes some weird noise from the speaker sometimes. PUBG gameplay very awesome no lags, HD graphics with high frame rate, rest all good
Nice CAMRA,full one day battery backup,good speed,full paisa wasool product.
very good

BEST FOR LOW BUDGET
I was worried about this phone before buying this phone due to some negative review.. But after 3 flash sale and so many tries from different account I got this mobile... I Play PUBG daily but haven't seen any hitting issue at all..  It's performance top notch...  No major ads problem even I never notice any ads.. It's built quality is premium.. As I never use 2nd sim Hybrid slot doesn't matter to me... First it's  camera bump is too big for me even after case but within week I am use to it.....
good
48 MP camera is just a formality, actual image quality is 12 MP and it also heats up with 5 min of usage. Battery backup is good with fast charging support and display quality is slightly improved from Note 6 Pro. Phone feels very heavy in hand and processor is not optimized properly with MIUI 10. You may see lags in heavy intenive tasks like Pub G and Asphalt 9. Mi ads coming in their own apps are irratates the users but its not a big issue. Phone is good and sturdy but performance not feels...
Awesome.... Value for money
not good

this is the best smartphones will get under 15k segment. Awesome performance, better battery, killer camera.

best phone under 15000
Best Phone.
Great performance as expected, camera is good but don't expect a flagship camera experience, display is good almost feels like AMOLED, speakers are loud enough with decent bass, UI is smooth, the only issue is with fingerprint sensor which is not fast enough at least for me and battery backup, I'm not a tech expert but a 4000mah should last at least 1-1.5 day but I 'm only getting backup of 12-14 hours with moderate usage, I'm not into gaming so I have absolutely no idea about gpu performance...
Excellent mobile...

This is a monster piece phone createe by xiomi. Best in class definitely. Just 1 complain, not sure if it the problem In all the pieces or only in mine, the Volte facility is disabled in my phone, raised a complain to the Servify team also but i have been told to visit nearest service station for this issue. I would just like to suggest the team if this problem is consistent with others as well, it would be great if u get this fixed with the MIUI 11 update.

awesome but heat mobile
Quality of the phone for the price range is awesome. Starting from the build quality to the performance everything is good. Camera is nice for the price. Although I think the "night mode" (under camera) is not great as advertised. May be future software update will upgrade it (if xioami wants!!). Display is crisp. Software is subjective. Battery is great. With SD 675AI the overall performance of the phone is awesome. True value for money
great device
super good product battery backup 1 1/2 day only
best in price and performance...
First there was an issue with 48mp camera but after update, it's okay now and it's superb in this price range

Excellent budget phone under this range.Great display,great batery backup,excellent sound,built in quality is also good.Only one draw back is Camera's performance.It lags too much,hope redmi will give update soon to overcome this problem.
unbelievably phone perfect display front camera also super I just loved it
Awesome
You cannot beat Xiaomi. Pocket friendly budget and high end spec. The phone looks premium in black ( just my point of view) but blue and other colours are too good too. In the price range the specs are very great. And I think Mi has gained the trust of our and one can easily trust them and buy their phones.

The product is amazing! For the price, there is nothing really to complain here. It is fast and smooth. The camera performance is decent for the price range. The blue color which I got is excellent.  It is a gradient shade and looks super cool in person. Overall this is a must buy product in this price range as there is no direct competition in this range.
It's an awesome phone the only drawback is this have a hybrid sim slot rest it is perfect

excellent built quality... nice camara.... nice display... go for it
mobile is very osm. actually pros more then cons. cons is 2-3 like hybrid sim slot, heavy weight, camera bump is very out from back surface. n camera is very good. screen is also very good if compare with others redmi mobiles. sound is very good of both speakers. i cant say that music sound is low. means from my opinions music sound is high. that's means over all performance is very good. this is valuable for money. n i want say also one thing that flipkart service is very fast. thnxx flipkar...
awesome Mobile phone
camera is good
Neptune blue was a much better choice
Currently this is the best you can buy at this price range. I saw some people complaining about earpiece but as of now I didn't face such issues .But there is this huge camera  bump that is among the thickest we have seen on smartphones recently you need to invest on good phone cover to protect it from damage. l am attaching both 48mp and 12 mp shots to get you an idea about the camera performance.
nice Vera level
Low cost and awsome mobile

super phone
Nice
I bought this phone on the 3rd sale. So far so good. Fully satisfied with the performance. this phone doesn't heat up during day to day usage and the camera is too good. It always stays at 12mp, but if you switch to 48mp, captured photo takes 10sec to process. So that 48mp option is not for quick capturing. It a little gimmick. 48mp is good for capturing landscape..take your time and capture the beauty at the highest resolution. All other things are perfect.... ram management is on point. Ove...
Best mobile smartphone under 15k.. Camera is good while using with 12 MP, but not that much with 48 MP Night mode is excellent. Overall good package under 15k..
This phone is awesome but the bump camera is not good it scratched
Had high hopes from this phone but there are some serious issues that needs to fixed. First of all batter is draining heavily. Also it has heating issues which no one is actually talking about. And the ram management is poor.
excellent
This is awesome mobile, camera is good, battery life extraordinary, model wonderful.. but some software is struck some time, Not all time. And Ads so irritating, but i change some settings now a time reduce the ads little bit... Otherwise mobile is Ultimate level... 90/100
very good mi note7pro

awesome phone in this price...I'm happy
Writing the review after 10 days of usage..Got this phone with axis bank credit card 5% offer on emi.Now,whether you guys believe or not but 48 MP actually does a fabulous job in retaining the details of the pic...checks the images i am attaching,you guys would actually be able read one shop name which is actually in very dark and even i wasn't able to see the same with my eyes...so,100 percent it does a great job...yes,it takes little time to save the pics but that is not a big issue,it can ...

really value for money...
In this price range this is a good smartphone, but instead of giving 48 mp camera xiaomi should concern about the quality of camera. day performance of camera is good, but in night, there is so much noise in pictures. In terms of design and build quality i must give 5 stars to this phone as well as performance of this phone is also good .. overall a good package in this price segment, recommend to buy it..
my bad luck..over heating,hang problem,camera issue.....bakwas mobile

perfect phone on this price range with mind blowing features, i loved this phone, the only annoying thing is that when we using the camera a slight heating is there and some times the camera is not responding and then we should have to restart the phone, i think Xiaomi may resolve this problem through further updates...... and I'm waiting for that. any way I like this phone very much 😍😍

Camera 📷 is Good. Feels premium At this price segment. u can install Google Camera. U can play PUBG Mobile in High Settings without any Glitches 😋.

Redmi note 7 pro best phone
delivered be prefect good.
Worth buying.
I have seen so many negative reviews about the audio quality and display flickering. But i didn't experienced any of these problems till now. The only thing is, when we open the 48MP cam, sometimes its stop working suddenly and requires a reboot. That's the only problem I'm facing. I think it can be resolved by software updates. Overall the phone is superb.
Gorgeous...

The camera is not 48MP.. because snapdragon 675 have not 48MP ..in 48MP you can't use AI , Night mode .
Value for money,  48MP camera is awesome,  though it takes a few seconds to process but the clarity in all the modes work perfectly.  Battery is enough for a day's use on high performance settings.  Overall a nice bundle at the price.  😄
worth for a money
superbb quality performance...and I can't explain the quality of camera.. awesome👌👌😊😊😊
thanks for fast delivery budget beast
just wow
The phone is great for gaming. PUBG runs very smooth. If u are thinking of buying a phone for gaming purposes then it is the best option. Coming on to the camera,is really impressive. but if u r really not in to getting the latest processor SD675 and the so called 48 mp camera,, u can go for the redmi note 7 also. I will tell that it has also got great gaming performance..
nice product

Recommend phone....their no phone to beat in this range..
A phone which can even beat a flagship. It has an exceptionally good camera which seems to be better than Oneplus 6T in terms of sharpness and dynamic range. After all someone's word is proved to be right by MI that- "Cheap phones are getting good. And good phones are getting cheap."- MKBHD(Marques Brownlee).

Awesome Phone with Killer specs...Totally Satisfied With This Phone
good phone on price range. initially for the product that had speakers problem. flipkart replaced it. decent battery life. initially got good battery life, after week usage, i see drop in avg drop in battery performance. 48mp camera is good. display quality is good. face recognition and figure scanner worms great. overall decent buy. just have a check on audio speakers after buy
The phone is excellent considering the price point.The camera is the one thing that stunned me the most, i mean the it handles the tricky photos is amazing and the bokeh mode which xiomi has given..... is truely a game changer even sometime it can compete to a professional DSLR camera.                                                                                 ______________________Pros & Cons_____________________.

superb phone in terms of performance.. camera average.. for pubg no issue..speaker sound average. .. no search option for apps in menu like sony/samsung/moto, so takes time to find  installed app.
Perfect example of value for money.

Nebula red looks stunning.Best phone under 15 k . Earpiece is average but other than that it is a great phone.
Totally satisfied with this device.
Just wow! I compared its camera with one plus 5t, and guess what! It is much better, it has wider angle, colors and clarity is much better. It is easily worth 30k. No wonder why it is getting out of stock in 2 seconds!

Amazing Smartphone I have ever seen in my life. The camera beast it too good to perform your day to day multitasking. medium battery efficient. You will have to charge it ones perday .(Recommended to buy Mi 10000MAh power bank which supports quick charge 3.0).I wasn't having another smartphone so I could not upload many images.

Best phone in this price range. Camera is the best part of the phone, images are awesome without 48 megapixel also. Battery charges quickly. They should have given some apps for the files like PDF,ppt instead of sharechat and other but that's fine. Best performance for high end apps. Sound quality is too good. I haven't found any con about the for now. Delivery took 5 days that's disappointing. PAISA WASOOL PHONE. Display is blinking at low brightness.
Nice one
If you are a MI user then you can not feel anything different with the phone until you are going to clock the pictures or video shoot or playing any kind of game...Body finishing is marvelous.looks like a premium class phone. Great stell in this price segment.

For user like me, who switch their phone from 5 inch screen to 6.3 inch screen, so obvious that it feels little heavy. Camara night mode works very well. No complaints in camera department. Battery backup is ok. Update after almost 1 month, restart automatically.

If you have used Samsung phones then this phone display will look dull . But rest all things are too good . for this price you will be amazed how fast and lag free it is . This is my second Asus. First was m1 . Some features in this are not present in m1 also like screen shot icon net speed . Screen is bright . GPS for maps work best . volume is loud enough . No finger print scanner but if it is there also you won't like because Asus finger print scanner is (m1)slow and every 10 times it will...
Very good quality
great ph at 5k
Alweys super mobile
very good mobile at this price range...camera is very good...touch response also good...if battery backup is little bit more...then this could be better than redmi 5a.
Excellent mobile

Phone is good,Delivery also fast..But i have one request for all people,Don't trust flipkart,because when i'm ordering time already they mentioned including earphone and some things..but i didn't get anything  in box..only charger and sim removing pin, phone is very good 7star i will give ...but better you can use Amazon.before ..before iam using that one...Amazon is very good

Asus zenfone lite L1 does the job in this compact budget range.This phone is very light also looks not bad.Camera,display,performance are just above moderate,bettery service not bad.4G volte for 1 sim at a time.Cons are speaker not that good for voice call,internal storage is too small to use,also lots of unnecessary apps present.Overall this phone is good in this tight budget range👍

Nice phone but baterry nt excellent but ok
good phone but the face recognition is a bit slow.
1st of all this phone is not for the young generation,for it is a very slow phone,the touch is also not as good and responsive as it ought to be.. you will have only 7 gb of space in internal memory.. further when you install  above 9 apps the phone starts hanging.. like I said not for younger generation.. the battery drains like anything, you'll  have to charge every morning if you're back moderate user,while if you're back heavy user the battery goes from 100 to 00 in couple of hours of vid...

Worst quality product. From first day, I am facing internet issue with this mobile. I tried all possible test or check but problem not resolved. Flipkart and ASUS both are unable to resolve this issue. I am literally frustrated due to aforesaid issue. No resolution. Never ever purchase ASUS mobie.

While the phone itself is quite good (excellent when you take into account the fact that it cost only 4999), it came just with itself and charger. There was no back cover, no screen protector, no earphones.

good phone in this price segment got in 5k
big battery
Asus Zenfone lite l1 is Nu1 Smartphone in this year I lovet this phone well Done
I am writing this review after using the phone for 12 days. The battery backup lasts for only 4-5 hours on normal usage. The camera quality is nice. 2GB of RAM makes this device a little slow for high end graphics apps. The sim card works fine on other devices but gives slow connections on this device. Overall this is a very bad product. Greatly disappointed.

thanks for Asus for giving a value for money smartphone but the charger in the box is not from Asus this is very bad. please Asus don't do that hence,your smartphone is very good.
very good
CAUTION CAUTION...If you have an olf phone then only buy this one. You can't setup your Asus zenfone lite L1 as a new devive. It has only one option to copy data from an old phone and even that does not work also. I have returned it.

I have bought this phone during the mobile Bonanza sale for 3.5 k and after 7 days of usage I'm writing this review. This is the worst smartphone I have seen. There is no such thing called optimization in this phone. There are bugs in every corner of the phone. Whenever we report any problem to Asus on their zentalk community the moderators will ignore and divert the issues to the app developers and they won't fix it. The only fix that they will tell you to do is clear cache and clear data, f...

beyond expectations there's only one problem is with its audio output in earphone that's worst.
all good about the phone but its hang too much and sound is too low
Do not buy this phone. It lags all the time. App loading takes longer time. Snapdragon is not successful in entry level position, and 430 proves that. The phone is so slow that you will definitely hate it.
slim design very good phone for daily use
The product is nice and quality is good at the price range.

i have been using this device for last 10days. the best vfm phone under 5k. at this price no other phone provides sd430 which is an octacore processor normally found on phones above 7k. Display quality is decent for the price. Front camera is decent but rear camera is good. Battery life is moderate. phone dosent support dual 4g volte so thts a con. overall hands down best phone under 5k

as expected
I ordered 2 devices, one is very good, but the other one is a defective piece. The device is restarting regularly. I asked for replacement/refund. Flipkart cancelled my request stating that we called you and you didn't respond to our calls. I put another request and this time Flipkart sends a technician and he said the device is perfectly fine, and he rejected the replacement.

Battery problem .. I have to visit service centre now .. I ordered this mobile on feb 6th and I got it on Feb 8th.. I was out of station my parents received the product .. I came 3 days back :.. when I check the mobile continuously three days .. battery is draining very fast without using the mobile .. today I called Flipkart cc .. they told me to visit near by service centre cou 10 days time is over for return policy... I’m hoping I may get battery replaced.. let me see .. what will happen..
Phone is more or less good but sometimes lags. So I can't give it 5* rating. It is not so good what I expected from reviews but not bad
Very good budget phone
nice
Under this budget, this phone is very good. But don't expect great things or "bit more than good" from this phone. Handles multiple tasks "quite good". but keeping in mind the budget this phone is fantastic. Camera quality is decent. No complains on battery. I will definitely suggest this phone to all the students who already have computer (and who don't play PUBG)
superb
Heavy looking..nice product,but Mobile good
good product with this price but internet is not working properly ...and I have to charge it's battery for every 5 hours..

Phone's Network completely goes within 30 days, very disappointed with asus. It was my first phone from ASUS & 1st experience goes very bad. Now my phone is in ICU...... lol!!! Let's see what happen. Overall Phone performance is good, eg. camera, display, speakers, battery life, UI etc. I will never gonna buy ASUS products. ASUS service center refused to repair the phone & advised to approach JEEVES (complete mobile protection) Thanks to flipkart's Complete Mobile Protection policy I ...
Only value for money.. and overall its ok
got it for ₹5008 with 1 year of complete protection, at this rate you should not compare it and just grab the deal. specs are well worth the price...ease of use..good ui...best for giving it to employees or gifting purposes
Update after using for a month : my parents are usein these mobiles, i just went back and checked them today. The performance is horrible, they are jsut using whats app and YouTube heavily. Just pressing back tap takes lot of time and hangs heats up a lot like iron box. Intially the mobile was good when I received it, but now no ways!!! Money got wasted, need to buy them a good mobiles again since they became practically unusable. MI Mobiles are extremely good and reliable, so will be buying ...
No video call from dialler.

Good at price
Speaker Quality is worse. Volume is very low, For high volume there is option in settings menu to set Outdoor Mode but when you do that the sound is crackling and very irritating. Also, do not except good build quality. A general advise to the buyers, don't go for the marketing gimmick, rather spend 2000 more and you can get better option in the market.
hanging problem
Automatically calls going without any dial
don't Buy this phone worst phone for ever .. I am not received Phone charger With phone

Nice phone and it gives a nice performance and the battery life is also good. It has gaming mode which makes playing games easier on the phone. The micro phone is also nice and so is the speaker however the battery cannot be seperated from the phone by the user. Just one point less in Value For Money section as it does not provide any headphones.

Awesome phone at this price range. Front and rear cameras - both are excellent. Handles normal day to day usage like a boss. Battery usage is normal, enough for a normal user to last one day. Color reproduction and PPI is also good. Includes an ambient sensor(for automatic brightness). Somewhat disappointed by face recognition system.

Mobile is good based on price but battery is very poor at least one day is not coming to charging
Mic is not working properly nobody hear my voice on call the earphone quality is very bad
Phone heating problem
Good battery n good camera thank u Lenovo
Nice thing
It's over heating
Good
Constantly heating up, wen using mobile. Heat becomes doubles wen put to charge
good one
The phone is good.an average phone.but never order for 4gb ram.3gb ram phone is more good than 4gb. because i were using3gb before,but now I got 4gb.it is same as 3gb.then what a need for 4gb.otherthan it is best option
I am using this product. Battery and Dolby sound is the excellent. But, mic and ear speaker are bad. Rest are all fine in this range. Check before investing in this product.
Excellent smartphone  n very fast delivery n flipkart executive excellent response........
Nice product, seems to be value for money as of now.
Phone hangs touch screen not working properly of call end poor quality of mic.... please don't buy such a weast of money very bad
This product very bad mic problems
When the battery become low(below 16%) mobile starts hanging...too much problem for charging and charger also...when we turned off wifi Bluetooth automatically gets on...
It is a heating problem
Mic problem after 4 fays
Good phone 4gb ram and all but Snapdragon 430s a tad bit slow in processing
Really awesome device .. thanks Flipkart and Lenovo .
Best Camera
Good sound system..
Very poor product..... Having trouble with product
Camera quality very poor. Sound good, battery good, network needs improvement. No heating during normal usage. Display also doesn't feels like full hd. Lenovo is using poor quality display. Sometimes slight hanging. Headphone socket malfunction. Motherboard replaced. Now volte not working. Again going to Lenovo service.Lenovo service very poor
I got the it's very nice at the my friend also bought his phone is working properly but mine is hanging requested for new one .........but......let's see
Good
Best
Good,but becomes hot very often while charging and also while operating for a long time
Mobile best but camera issue
Mike Problem in this particular Model.
Overheating the mobile
First one has battery issues and this, second one has mic issues..(don't know how many unidentified hardware and software issues are...) I was presuming issues could be with network provider, but after so many test phone calls, concluded that this phone is also delivered with lots of defects. Now, "Flipkart" you advice me what to do with this problematic device??
Not as per the expectation.
Good
The person on the other end of the call cannot hear the voice unless spoken to very loudly or sometimes have to tilt the phone towards the mouth to talk. Please fix the error. Lenovo is a reputed company.I feel cheated.
The product is awesome and worth of money. Especially the processing speed. Thanks for the snapdragon octacore processor, 4 gb RAM Loaded with marshmallow. The bio metric login sensor is an additional feature which made it ease to operate with single hand, the same sensor acting as a button for snapshot is amazing, it matters a lot for selfie poses.
Good handset... Working fine ... But mic placement is not good ..And camera quality is below average.... I'll not recommend this..,, problem in after sale service.. becoz it's has only collection point.
Good product
Very good phone div by 1day very fast thanks F. K
Super Smart phone - Camera,Battery,4Gb Ram,Dolby,VR ,Android N .nice Flipkart Service !!
Nice...  Mobile
Very nice product
Very good phone. Lots of RAM and enough space. Camera quality is good. Go for this device.
Very nice product by Lenovo
This is a totally embarassing phone do not buy this phone,screen brightness problem,sensor problem
The Touch was now working properly..NOW WORTH IT
Good mobile.. Camera, display, and battery were the positive. Hybrid slot is a big demerit!!!!
Very bad
Likely mobile
After 2-3 month every k6 power battery not being charged, if you want to fully change you have to keep it in charging for at least 16-20 hours ... Sencond problem this mobile is being hang ... Pls don't purchase this wrost mobile .... Avoid lenovo at all
Superb phone in this rate
Good phone, fast delivery, awesome
Awesome phone.....loving it....go for it guys.....Flipkart thanks for delivering the product before time.
Phone is awesome...camera quality is so good.  Thanks Flipkart.
Forest mobile I purchased in my life.Worked perfectly 10 days.After started problems.Unable answer incoming calls due to touch problem.Automatically calls getting dialed.Autimatically enables Bluetooth,gps.I give -5 rating.Please don't buy this mobile
Flipkart has started a business of looting people. They sell faulty products at low prices. The phone is terribly bad. Microphone is faulty and the phone heats up a lot. I would have given it a negative rating if there was an option to do so.
It's been more than a month... It's really good... I have not faced any problems till now... The speakers is awesome..... Dolby rockss.... <3
Good mobile under 10 thousand
Please don't be misguided by long reviews. Go for this phone. It's nice and value for money. It is a nice  phone.
Average...
No issues after getting replacement.Best phone below 10k..
As expected. Loved the phone
nice product
Really good phone in this price range. I have read multiple reviews about this before buying. But I want to say just few points. As the phone have 4gb ram with octacore processor, needless to say that this is fast and smooth. Now the main 3 points which I want to highlight are - 1. battery backup is very good. I am using this for more than two days without charging it again. 2. Speaker is very good and louder also. Does not compromise the sound quality if volume is increased. 3. Camera has a ...
New problem issued based on software , example if Mobile data is on while we surfing any apps it shows internet connection lost, I faced this problem within six hours when I inserted new sim
Awesome. Phone in awesome price
Good but battery is better more
Excellent handset at 10,999/- (for 4G RAM that purchased). Because of the 5 inch screen size the handset is comfortable to hold in hand and easy to carry in pocket. Metallic body, full HD display, huge RAM, huge 4000 mAh battery which runs easily for 2 days, Dolby digital sound, 13mp back and 8mp front camera which gives nice pictures, Nougat 7.0 OS (updated after purchase) are some of the main features that are even missing in high end phones, makes it a perfect choice for general users. The...
not able to hear the voice of the other person...given to service centre ...they told that require to update the software....one day they took to update the software bit still the same problem appear....now more than 3 month but still the same problem appear.
Bought a Lenovo K6 Power but surprisingly I am finding that this set is defective... And customer care says that now u need to go to service center and service center says that the mobile will take 15 days to repair.
It's a good product with this price tag. The  graphic quality is to good and heavy games are also response awesome with 4 GB RAM.
Awesome
Great phone to start with. Got it delivered within a week of ordering. About the phone .... No complaints when you look at the price.
Very nice
Awesome. Value for Money.
Product was good worth to buy
Not satisfied with phone..As not working properly.
Dont purchase this phone..basic facility is calling that is not properly working..touch is also not responsive..so dint buy it..you will feel cheated if you buy this phone..nobody is taking responsibility lenovo nor flipkart..
nice phone
I AM USING K6 POWER FROM LAST 8 DAYS SOME ISSUES ARE THERE LIKE IT IS WITH 4GB RAM BUT SOMETIMES PERFORMANCE SLOW DOWN BUT OVERALL AS PER MY VIEW IT VALUE FOR MONEY AND REALLY A BEST PHONE OF LENOVO, HOPEFULLY PHONE WILL KEEP IT'S PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE.
Nice mobile
You guys delivered me defective product. It heats a lot that you can't hold in your hand. Called for replacement then received a call and person said to me for installing system update. I have done the same. But no improvement in problem. Again I requested to replacement then technician visit fixed but no technician visited. Not automatically you cancelled my replacement request. Either you replace the phone or refund me otherwise i have to take a strict action against you guys and your organ...
I have satisfied with battery backup and item outlook
As per order items, & description, I found the packing was not as per expected quality of service.
Best mobile to buy at this rate. Overall performance of mobile including camera is good. I suggest to buy the phone
Everything's Superb! Battery backup is marvellous. Camera and network reception are fantastic. Display is above average and i think it's protective glass. Few minor bugs like sluggishness  in  app responses(only while heavy multitasking)  might bother some but I consider them negligible. Waiting for Nougat update. And in my opinion, Redmi 3S Prime and this K6 Power are same in terms of hardware and usage, except Mi UI is more refined than Vibe UI.
1. MICROPHONE! Other person on receiving side is not able hear my voice clearly.  Similar issue are raised by other buyers also. Could be an issue with my piece.
Thanks to Flipkart
Nice phone...... Thanks Flipkart for fast and safe delivery....
Best mobile
value for money device at that time December 2017

Good mobile
Speaker problem and pictures, network display problem

Mobile is hanging. Producing too much of heat..
I have somehow exchanged the product, touch stops working at times, photos dont show properly in gallery, camera is excellent in low light area also, phone hangs at times, if these things wer alright i must say its a promising one from lenovo
its a poor handset its speaker is not working at all I don't  like this phone and its an old set I played for new handset only.
This product is nice but getting warm up after playing video.
Good Product for battery backup and camera is awesome...😀
l am using this brand of mobile is amazing in this price.i purchased the same brand again .As concerned the service  rendered by Flipkart is upto the satisfaction, thanks Flipkart.
The mobile is good and easy to handle
Good
Excellent phone !!!
gud and awesome delivery services
Poor hardware
its lags a lot man ... no updates from Lenovo .... fingerprint lags .... camera poor ... good dolby speakers ... thats it
The product is good but it have some lagging problem will using high speed internet
Waste of cost.
Even though it has 4 GB ram the phone still gets hang and the back cam is such a horror front cam is so good
Worst mobile I've used ever
Good
Issue with the performance. Hangs frequently.
Excellent product
Cool budget phone ever
Excellent battery power
GooD with Great Battery and Camera
Great phone after my 1 year of usage nearly loved it
Very poor performance, rt now using its 4gb ram model, but sometimes its works like a 1 gb ram mobile. Too much hanging problem. Very disappointed.
I bought lenovo k6 power 6 months ago , regularly i got hanging issue in my phone and charging portal problems ,phone heating while charging.
Best phone in the segment it's battery is lasting for almost 2-3 days...Dolby sound is good
Really poor camera please don't buy it guys.
Very bad .... Not user friendly
This product sounds like a china phone. Even though it has a RAM of 4GB it is working very slowly. Camera is good. The remaining features are good.
Getting hang during incoming calls and some time randomly goes hang. And there are no heavy applications or game in my device.
Good products
Very good
So much of heating phone
Nice
Good gadget

Excellent . battery backup superb
Super fone in budget but don't expect life more than 2years
Good product .but touch screen is not as expected as I thought! Dolby Atmos is powerful
Do not go for Lenovo mobile having network issue within 3 month one time per day I must have restart Lenovo phone to catch proper natwork...strongly suggest not to buy this phone
I have already ordered this phone before one week response very nice I like this phone and I request you to buy this phone because it has nice battery price camera and good voice recorder here it is nice to play game in this is a wonderful fun with an hour but I really thank you Flipkart because I have order because before one week but it has the fast delivery because before 3 days it I order it came in 1 days so I request my dear friends you can buy this phone. You can buy this phone because...
Loud speaker used mic super.insert the Airtel sim perfect the 4g network
I bought this K6 power note4 GB 15 days back.. over all good. Few of them not match our expiation.. head phone totally waste.. there is auto network.. ie. If we want only LTE.. option is not there. LTE/WCDMA/GSM AUTO mode only avail. So what happening if we are in out of city.. network speed automatically changed. This is another draw back..
Worest mobile,worest service centres,I am purchasing this mobile last 4 months ago, charging problem, speaker problem,charger problem... time waste and money waste....
Superb budget phone
Not up to the mark.. Touch part Li's little bit slow
Nice mobile

Good smart phone
Mobile super but bad serviceing centers
I got this phone from flipkart in an ongoing offer. It costed me 8998. For this price, the phone feels awesome. Battery lasts for complete day no matter how rigorously u use it. Screen size is optimum (5 inch) which makes it to fit in pockets easily. Ram, processor speed is decent if not used for playing game. Phone came with Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and  upgraded to 7.0 (Nougat) and it works perfectly fine for me. Still I have not received any prompt for 8.0(Oreo) update. But the phone hang...

its fantastic and yes it has a heating problem but  that may be because i use my phone continously so,otherwise its a perfect phone  .
Awesome one!!!!! got it on exchange..... excellent...good phone
People on the other side of the call complain me of poor audibility. I have to shout on the tip of the voice to embarrass people sitting around me. Little painful to ears for the long talk.  Sometimes hangs and had to restart.  Data connection is good.
Good
EXCELLENT
Ossmmm my lenova k6 I really love ,,
Bettry back up and hanging problem
The handset frequently Malfunctioning and Hang. sometime not taken any action after no.of touch on screen only after power on/off button. Display jittering/screen vibrates between two pages.Not easily selection of Ringtone, we have to rotate all Audio Files.No Gallary  only File Manager.NO simple editing of Photo/image available.Clock display/background/theme can not be changed or downable ????
phone hanging problem in updated Android 7
Excellent product
Camera quality is not so good. . Also phone gets hang frequently. . Takes minimum 15-20 seconds after unlocking it by finger touch
Mic problem while calling to someone
I recieved it in a very bad condition. The phone was full of scratches and the finger print sensor was not working.
Purchased the lenovo gold. The prize looked very lucrative. But unfortunately the product is not all the good. The camera is mediocre. Voice quality also a concern  In the same price range the xiaomi mi4i my previous buy was an excellent purchase. .. the sole saving grace was flipkarts fabulous delivery experience. Dr Tripti Dhote
Disappointed with Lenovo :(
mic issue, my voice is not receive by caller
Wrost product.. show so much hanging problem..waste of money
Not that much superb, low performance, low capacity of ram , Naam bade or darsan khote , i suggest to buy another brand lost performance of Lenovo from past few years
Very good
It good
Better
Better to say good bye to China products..
Lenovo K6 power very slow functioning very slow response working condition too slow
Better options available...
More heat..low camera ..

There is no other phone in the market after researching, I found only this phone with 4GB Ram, 32 GB memory, Power Bank charging option, of this Best Price and Quality....Thats Lenovo !
Used for 1month almost... All the things working good... But sometime touch did not work properly... Except it all things are working good
Using this phone for almost a week no issues found everything was correct as I think my luck was good did not get an damage or factory fault cell phone. Its a good budget phone and the battery is good enough ...I suggest low budget people like me can surely go for it and I wish them best of luck.

Kikass power no 1 phone
One star for battery  that's it. Heats up abnormally. Headphones hard plastic,lousy charger and pins. My fourth lenovo phone probably last lenovo. Medicore camera. Screen ok if just used for viewing simple things.  Otherwise its just good to be an extra modem and basic call functions.
Justify the price and features anticipated in today's requirement.In total ,impressive phone.Go for it.

Great mobile , good battery backup,nice sound,great features
Fantastic phone
Good mobile.awesome product

Good
Best phone, specially for Ram, rom, Dolby Atmos & battery in this low price range.
Nice
Superb product at a very reasonable price.
worst mike function... i think its not working
Its not a Volte handset. if you guys going to buy a VOLTE set. just remeber worst product ever. its continue restarting.  Applications not working properly.
Pathetic phone I bought it on 6 March from that day it has given me so much of trouble ... Lenovo sucks
Mobile hanging and heating problem
Nothing gud in this phone cheap in all segment so dont go these type of phone.
Everything is good only thing is this is my second lenovo mobile and both gets over heated after certain time
Don't buy any product from flipkart it's a worst co. In the world specially electronic items
excellent
Waste phone
Full hang mobile and Automatically switch off and switch on
Mic not working
Don't buy this product . Proximity and some other sensor is failing while running sensor tests. Due to this issue you will get lot of apps will open automatically and without your notification calls will be triggered. Don't spend too much on this product.
One of the worst phone I have ever used.A lot of issues regarding speaker.Cant hear a word.Very low network on any service provider.
After  5 working days ,mobile was suddenly switch off.i was show to service center,they said " mother board issue" and they arrange new Mother board and set into that mobile,but same complaint again....
Some prblm is getting in phone
Phone was over heating while charging and talking
Mic problem .....ear phone is too bad
Very bad product! It is resetting after every 2hrs. Received defective product. This problem started after the replacement period offer
So far facing no issues and yes don't download that 70 mb update it is showing. You'll start facing mic issue after that.
Good phone on this price range . Good battery backup
Good but some change also you done in it give free Jio sim with Lenovo k6
Super ☆☆☆☆
I'm using this frm last 6month;very nice experience🤗
Don't go for Redmi note 4 .........Lenovo k6 is excellent
Good

K6 pawer
Good product
Thank-you
i think this is the best smartphone in this price category. i love it
It's a good and nice mobile.
Awesome
Very nice camera quality as per expectarions but there are little software bugs.
Value for money product
Nice phone
Good
Handling is grrt .... Problem is it works totally nil...wen the ROM fills... Other thing is it locks automatically.. Sometimes while working
Good product
Good
Best phone in a good budget.
Latest update not stable fingerprint not working good
Value of money, nice.
Price drastically drops post purchase.... Felt cheated. Oversize for a five incher
Phone is good..... But the problem is Mic not working properly
Pros-(1)5"fhd display (2) Dolby Atmos sound (3)front camera (4) fingerprint sensor (5)4000 mah battery. Cons-(1) mobile grip should be better (2) heating issue
The mobile has no issue since three months, but now some times it says unfortunately stopped and restarts of its own
Phone has mic issues, I replaced it again same problem
This Flipkart compni not good. This product is very dangerous . it's very heat create and many times hanging problem create when this is 4gb ram
Good phone but having big issue with the microphone when we speak with other person on mobile, another person is not able to listen you this is the big fault in the handset.
Software has bugs ... Like Lenovo theme is showing as harmful app. Cellular call quality is not good.. other side person need to guess what I am saying.. rest it is working like any other phone in this category. I have used only for 2 week... Battery is good.. camera quality is ok or same as other competitors in this price range.. the thing is that I am trusting Lenovo brand. Rest I will know when phone get older.
It's an awesome mobile except for the fact that it heats up when it's in charging state. The heating can really bug you cuz it heats up so much. Besides that battery, display and sound quality crossed my expectations and I am totally satisfied that I brought the product. Hoping that the heating issue is due to some software malfunction and that Lenovo would launch a software patch as soon as possible. Leaving all that aside I would recommend this phone to all who wants a mid range costing phone.
Value for money and excellent battery backup
Good phone... Value for money. I was purchased it only 9900rs. 4gb ram version. Very good display. Camera is also very good. Thanks Flipkart.

Nice phone ..
Nice deal.   Thanks to Flipkart.
I am not a professional expert in giving reviews about a product. Just sharing my views. First pros 1)Battery is amazing no doubt. 2) Dolby - Awesome no doubt. 3) screen 5 inch fits in your hands. 4) Ram and Rom. Now cons 1) mic biggest disappointment. Even if you shout other person is unable to hear properly.
Excellent. Lenovo K6 Power 4GB
I purchased this mobile after reading various review . Thinking that mic issue would be with      one with some phone but it seems it is a manufacturing defect of company.that most of people have mic problem . The mic issue is genuine. I am also facing mic issue in my phone.
The product is having mic problem. No one at other side can hear my voice clearly when speaking to him. Facing tremendous issue for voice call. Lenovo shall resolve my issue immediately.
Awesome mobile but having big mic issue.....I would not recommend to buy better option is redmi note 4 ...11000/- same segment phone with better option and performance
My mobile performance is worst.mike issue is there.service provided by Flipkart is not good.
Worst phone mic problem mobile eeting problem no buying this phone
Received defective phone with mic not working, need replacement, highly frustrating, no foll

I have purchased 4 piace of this model
Not bad
Phone is very bad not good
Nycc phone
It is a good smart phone with more features in low cost. Value for money.
Excellent handset. 2 days battery backup. VOLTE works perfect. Have filled 22gb of movies and music. Still no lag. 4GB RAM is great. Only issue is the hybrid sim slot. I knew that before buying, so no complaints. Dedicated slot for memory would have been the cherry on the cake....
Battery is not good
After two months of usage, everything is great except mic, it's not working properly & no support from Lenovo for resolution.
Phone is good at this price but sometines touch is not working at corner of phone and good battery life ,average camera,low light photography is below par
Good
Ek no. Phone
Total phone features are good but heating problem is to much
Very Good
I mistakenly dropped my phone in water,after some time it working and not starting when trying to start,should i am eligible for warranty against this
Worst service by Flipkart. They delivered me out of order device, when I requested for replacement/return of device and they sent technician after 8 days of request. Technician suggest me used this device with formatted memory card or new memory card for smooth working of device and even then if device will not work well then we will replace your device. So I accepted his condition and thought let's tried with new memory card for two days. And this device is also not working smoothly with new...

i am also facing microphone problem. during call, person from other side cannot hear my voice. i also read reviews on flipkart, lot of people are facing microphone problem on Lenovo K6 power.
Worst mobile, mic is not working.

Everything is good but microphone was disappointed

Waste mobile
Mic problem
Battery getting too hot while charging.
Feeling like a heater
The phone is good, but it as a mic problem
It's not good, it have lot of problems. Just like sleeker very bad quility, touch not work properly etc.
Replacement product also speaker problem.
Worst phone
Excellent speed and back up plus we can another account which doesn't contain any of its extra storage
Good phone
It's all good in average n some feature r lacked as compared 2 other phone on this range.....n mobile sometime got hotter on charging....again seeing description on camera it's written 8 mp instead 13mp. No gallery app.no user friendly file manager app...in mostly to the current genre it's good @ whole..but no specialisation....as Lenovo.
Nice product ,nice camera,it can use in one hand nicely,little sliper without back covers,it avoid by using covers,nice display,good battery,nice product,thank you Flipcart,but I wait too many days for reach this product,make this good flipcart,thank you

Awesome phone but cheater Flipkart bullshits Morone Flipkart as soon as I received my phone  Flipkart announced 1000off on this phone I am very angry for this
Its best as per its price . .
Nice phone.unexpected battery backup
good in every manner
Best deal
Phone is really funtastic
Supbb... Mobile @10000 the best budget phone in market 👌👌👌👌
Phone looks good in hands but there are few bugs in software. Lenovo had to fix it in  upcoming update. Microphone can sense loud sound only, so while talking one had to talk louder so that other person in other side can hear it.(this might be a hardware problem).
Mic issue, worst mic experience it is a complete blunder.
It's too bad on camera clarity but battery backup is vry excellent
Mic problem
It has network reception problem. I have tried three different service provider. In every service it has network problem. Even speaker voice is also bad.
Mobile is good for the price bracket . The peice I have got having mic problem .. but thanks for cart for fast replacement......
Great product for the price. Superb battery life and processing speed. The only point against it is it's camera which isn't that great
Nice
Product delay
Screen dancing automatically for 1-2 minuts after one or two hour.
Good one.....
Nice phone.. .
Nice product in budget. Quality and features are awesome. No mic prblm since 4 months till today. Sounds good. Dnt know why all people facing mic prblm. I'm using it n nothing there. Battery is good, camera is good, fingerprint is good, UI is good... all things are good.
Very good performance, satisfied
Mic not working properly waste to purchase
Very good phone in a decent price.g ot this phone at electronic sale rs.10,000. It's battery backup is too good. I will suggest you to chose this 4Gb variant over redmi 3s prime.you can also look for mi 4 note. if you want all features better. But believe me guys, this phone has got better camera, better battery, better HD screen,better Dolby 2 speaker.  Phone is also not getting heat to much. Everything is blazing and fast. If you are looking for budget phone, then this variant is unmatchabl...
This product says 4gb Ram but 2 gb Ram used for storing apps. Finally available Ram is only two gb
Working perfect
Mic problem
Mic is not working as good. Receiver can't heard the voice as loudly...

BUDGET PRICED PHONE.EVERYTHING IS WORKING FINE EXCEPT I'M GETTING TOUCH ISSUE.WHENEVER I SCROLL SOMETHING DOES NOT SCROLL SMOOTHLY. I UPDATED TO THE LASTED SOFTWARE BUT THE ISSUE IS STILL THERE.
It's getting overheat. While i'm charging it catches up to 45 degrees. Sometimes I can't hold it in my hands also.
Mobile is very good for this budget... Good camera quality, battery back up, Dolby sound, display clarity, processor speed and performance, body design are so good.. But default gallery is not there, poor headset, outdated UI and mic & touch issues periodically...
Full fill phone in this rate all right

Smooth. .fast. . .awesome camera quality. .plus pointed with dolby . .but but but. .speakers are not suitable for voice recording. .
Package received  well within time. Product is similar as described in the specifications. Its a nice budget phone with all the advanced features like 4GB RAM, 1.4 octa core processor which makes it functioning smoothly. Camera is also nice not having many functions, but still holds good. Overall its an awesome phone as compared to its counterparts in the given price.
Good one

Defective Piece recieved.MIC not working.
Nice phone
i purchased this phone before two weeks, and now the microphone is not working fine.  persons from other side can't hear properly...i have to check it  with the lenovo service center.
I have not a good experience as this product has a microphone issue. I can hear but other person cant hear me.
flipkart is the number 1 site for making customers as fools - before 10 days purchase - i have placed a request for exchange of phone for overheating, then they are said wait for some time we will call back, and after 10 days flipkart is saying that seller is not accepting your request
Very fast ram...
Nice

Delivered on 3rd March. 15th March earpiece not working at all. Application downloaded from play store which states earpiece not working. Called Flipkart.... Not helpful at all because 10 days replacement warranty has expired even if its just 12 days. It seems that this Lenovo phone was waiting to make those 10 days expired and then it will go bad. Was happy with the phone infact bought 2 of them. Flipkart not helpful at all. Very bad experience with them.
battery is excellent 2 day online can be run . if u don't use internet it can run ur phone upto 3-4 days.  some feature's is not have in this phone like gesture - 3 finger used to screen shot , c for camera,  gesture is very good in oppo phones . but oppo is costly so good phone in that series lenovo k6 power .
Woohoo cool Mobile thanks
Good
Best of best budget phone. No problem i have found it now.
Rom is only 22.96 gb  available
I am totally fed up after investing 10000 rs in Lenovo k6 Power, I wanted to Buy MI4/MI4A but due to high demand I couldn't purchase. Now when I bought Lenovo due to Brand Image I found phone is getting hang whether 4GB ram is available and some important features like Phone gallery for photos and Videos, Music Player (Except Google Player) is missing. I couldn't expect it actually. Even Coolpad is giving a lot in 7000rs phone. Mic Is also not so strong.. Not a value for money product.
I think Flipkart selling second quality mobile or damaged products. I already bought lenovo mobiles from showrooms, i don't face any hardware issue. Now iam really disappointed with lenovo and Flipkart service. Lenovo K6 Power i bought have complaint in MIC and speaker. I bring the phone to nearest Lenovo service centre they told it was a Manufacturing fault. New phone having this kind of issues feels very much disappointed.
I BOUGHT LENOVO K6 POWER AFTER 9 DAY I FELL MIC PROBLEM AND HEATING PROBLEM TOO. MIC PROBLEM IS BIG VERY BIG PROBLEM IN CALL ANOTHER PERSON DON'T HEAR MY VOICE CLEARLY.
Got phone on time but later while using I found that there was some issue in mice. Person who was there on other side on phone could hardly  hear my voice. Took it to service center and issue is now resolved but I was supposed to leave my phone for 30 days in service centre itself. This was little disappointing.
It's a worst mobile I ever buyer before, heating like gas stove while talking nd chatting, automatically switch off, heavy weight like stone. Disappointing Lenovo mobile, guys plz don't buy this useless product.
Good
Bought this mobile 8 days ago overall performance is not up to mark as per expectations camera quality is pathetic and mic output is ridiculous on video calls as well as video shooting 4 GB ram gave smooth performance but screen is not as per on paper gaming experience is nice and smooth ,battery is really nice backup is good , day to day performance is good , little bit heavier on hands to feel overall can't recommend to others go for other options available in market
Received the product last week . I would like to report a issue in new handset .. There is MIC issue with the mobile during call , the other person can't hear anything . You need to use headphones or put it phone in loud speaker so that the other person in call can hear u.   Most of K6 power users reported the same mic issue. Also there is no proper update from Lenovo team. Kindly wait until there is any software update from them.Till then keep away  from this product. I planned to reach serv...
Problem in mic
It is an excellent product no need any doubt to buy this phone. It's not getting heet even using net also
Dont buy it, headfone is seeing that of 50 rs, bought by hawkers. In the range of 11000 you can go to redmi mi.
Excellent device for affordable price
Please don't buy this phone. Microphone problem is there..Other person cannot hear me itself...I don't know if Lenovo knows what a phone does - Calling feature...Other all things are additional only... Piece of crap. Going to request replacement from Flipkart.
I purchased this mobile from flipkart, thanks  to  flipkart for fast delivery. Mobile is a wrost don't go for this.
the worst
Very bad experience with Flipkart I got this handset just 2 days before n it's a faulty peace I have a speaker problem , during call I can't hear caller's voice n Ring too it's a major problem so plz don't buy or try to avoid this product .
third class product total watse of money nd fake site flipkart
One standard phone @ 10K. Cam, performance and battery life, entertainment (1080p) screen packed. Good phone. But they ruined Motorola for the favor of Lenovo brand.
Don't purchase this phone at all. Worst software interface. No 'ask every time'  option in SIM selection for SMS. When sending group SMS even landline numbers are being added and can't be removed. SMS are sending to landline numbers as well. Individual delivery report is not coming.
Once again Lenovo did a decent job, Fantastic phone for this cost. If you are looking for the budget smart phone definitely you can go for Lenovo K6 power. Flipkart is amazing , received the product in 48 hrs. Very decent packing! Thanks Flipkart!!
Lenovo k6 power was terrible , it was hanging all the time, do not buy Lenovo phones , I was not even able to pick the call sometimes, the display would be completely blank and would take minutes to crawl back, I need to restart the phone often  just to make calls, completely disappointed with the performance.
Very slow and sluggish behaviour, don't recommend
I have edited my rating to 1star....I wish I cud give u -1.... U made a born defective device lenovo....don't know if it's circuit related or design related or software related....the calls can't connect on 60% occasion....voice on the other side appears bleak...slows down with just a few apps installed(and those are mighty essential like video player...scanner...banking app... Online shpng..etc etc).....google photos app crashes on this device once u heavily load it with song or video or wha...
The phone features are good...no doubt...but the biggest drawback is the mic of the phn...the person on the other side cannot hear my voice...It was fine for few days after it was delivered but later this mic prob is really disgusting...
Worst camera clarity,the camera stopped working in few days of purchase and it goes to selfie mode automatically and never got back to normal mode.Takes long time for the battery to be charged.Its extremely hot while charging.
The main feature is its battery backup and ram that is compatible to all the features. The size of the phone is the best part in the phone coz carrying big size phones are bit difficult to handle. Thanks to lenovo for introducing this size and features.
I've been using this phone since past month. It's good so far, battery back up is awesome. I watch new on Jio TV, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube. Charging last for more than 36 hours also charges to full within 2 hours. Camera quality is good, front camera is also fine.
Camera Quality is very poor
One of the best and cheapest smartphone​ under Rs.11000 with 4gb RAM .Awesome display (almost like iPhone) .... super fast performance ...no lagging or hanging up.... Excellent Battery life....Only consumes 6 to 7 % battery if you play 2 hours long 720p video from your sd card or even use Wi-Fi ....fast fingerprint sensor ....other awesome features like double tap to wake up screen etc....DOLBY ATMOS is feckin awesome if you enjoy listening music on headset but you have to buy good quality he...
Nice product
Worst phone n worst service centres in 2 months only sim slots get damaged​ and service centres says need to change mother board as it's not come under warranty I have to pay ₹6500. Plz do not recommend this phone n company to anyone while buying mobiles..worst experience purchase at 11000 and now in 2months only I am not able to use.
Received the product just 2 weeks back. Prompt delivery, within 1 day. Thanks to Flipkart. Mobile is worthy to buy. Battery backup is good, no heating issue, sound quality is amazing, cam is ok and performance is superb. Finally I recommend this product to buy.
received defected item and requested to return in same day,but flipkart and the seller are cheated me, nothing they done to resolve the issue.phone getting over heated and mic also not working.by means of speaker only i'm speaking.don't trust flipkart return policy.i'm totally cheated by flipkart.
Surprisingly fast for a phone with 1.4 GHz CPU config. Very handy and the touch screen response is as good as any another high priced loonies out there in the market. Happy with the camera quality and the finger print sensor responsiveness. Overall I would rate 4/5 for this lil wonder. Thanks lenovo for coming up with a good working phone at a very affordable price.
This phone is supercool. Battery backup is awesome. Once u charge the phone, u will get a full usage with 4g internet and gps for 1 full day. And in power saving mode u can use it normally for 2 full days. Camera is cool in Daylight. It doesn't get hot at all..
Pathetic product
Fantastic
Overall nice features in this budget as compared to the other companies. camera & sound is too good. display and touch performance also good. Nice in the look. Good phone for the sound lover. Really feels DOLBY digital effect. Battery backup is very good. Only one thing that you can use only one sim with micro sd card. Both slot supports only nano simcard. One other thing is that ear phone came with the mobile is average and too big for the ears. Lenovo must provide good quality ear phones. P...
Very very nice phone, only think is that second SIM slot is hybrid. Camera , sound, touch, look all this is very nice .10/10
This phone was buying for my friend he said good camera and battery backup so good thank you Lenovo
Nice and cool
Nice phone and very quick delivery. Thanks to team Flipkart.
when call to some one other peoples are not able to hear our voice clearlry. very bad product
3 rd class phone..this is not only phone heater also......useing this phone 2 days only.......bhogas phone...
i bought this phone k6 power 4 gb ram, 20 days  before .the charger along with phone in  initial 5 days  takes 4 to 5hours for complete charging  and then about 10 hours and now it only show indication of charging i.e. no charging at all.flipkart is very reputed commerce company ,it is not supposed to sell such  defective items or once it should check quality of product before selling ,may be it product company fault.
Camera quality is very poor and also their is no refund policy in flipkart. So i am stuck with it.
Worst of worse
It is all that I wanted. Great microphone and great sound. Long battery life and great 4G reception. Responsive fingerprint unlocking. Rest of the specs too are amongst the best at present. A smooth digital experience.
Lenovo K6 Power for net browsing is ok. Screen resolution and touch sensitive good. But call quality is not good. We can't hear the caller voice some times. And caller don't receive our voice and voice is breaking.. and ear getting heated up... These are the problems.
I have booked three mobiles in this month therefore any special offers for me
Three days of full capacity use all i can say I'm pretty happy with performance. No heatting issue, no lagging, primium battery life last all day on heavy usage, i have done basic scratch test l, like keep keys and phone in same pocket screen is pretty much scratch proof, but on metallic part got some visible scratches, fitts well in hand can use single handed but back panel is slippery. All over happy with it. If you looking to buy I'll definitely recommend it.
Mic is not working properly.
Sweet handset. Good looking. Worth to purchase. But scratch Gaurd not in packet it's very difficult to purchase any basic accessories in local market or wait for another 2 of 3 day. Must be sell the products with all basic assets. Or  be sure to easily available in local market.
Not good as expected
Good phone  .camera normal quality.
The product is good but Flipkart service was very worse. I ordered Gold colour  and later followed up with Flipkart many times to exchange it in other colour but assistance was very disappointing. Now, they care more about the seller rather than customer. I was the loyal customer of the Flipkart but I am going shift to the Amazon going forward.
camera very slow, phone hangs often, sound output very good, charger very slow, camera very unsatisfactory.not recomended for camera, good for music. 4gb ram 32gb rom rs.11000/- i paid.
Best product and superb designed very lightweight piece.
Worth 11k . Good mobile . Happy to use
Goood
Rear flash light colour is mixed with yellow colour.Not only in white colour.selfie camera is awesome and rear camera quality is not so good.overall rating is 9/10.
Mobile automatically restart sometimes.in working Time..otherwise we'll bt this is problem nd mice not working good....
Device is just awesome at this price. 4 GB RAM works as the capacity says. No problems with the mic and the voice is clear. Don't believe the rumours. At this budget category, you won't find a better phone. Readers go for it.
Great product on that price . Gud
overall the product is very good, The  features of the phone is excellent but the worst thing is that the mic of the phone is not working properly. during the call  the voice is not heard by the other side
Product not good Quality of camera is worse and battery was draining like 1000 mah battery and screen is not HD but delivery speed of flipcart was very fast
Value for money but redmi note 4 is more better as we know note 4 isn't available so go for k6 power but you have to use this normal and boaring UI i.e., Normal Android UI but in Mi device you will get a better UI in MIUI.
Value of money .... Nice product...!!
Smart features
within 2 months of purchase this phone showed troubles , i took it to a service station and they gave me an estimate of 7155 to repair .. the phone is 11000 and they said since there is issue with mother board , it is not under warranty. I have been running around from pillar to post writing mails and escalating issue .. Lenovo is not worth buying .. Go for Motorola instead
The phone is superb unless you are expecting iphone6, notification panel is like that of stock Android (which is boring), courier service first said they will accept card but on the time they denied, little bit heating when I play death trigger, camera is good but auto focus is not there
Good One and fast delivery,

Good product
This phone was the OK in 2017 when I bought. But then, since I started using it for gaming, it just got hot and hot each second. Even when Im watching videos on YouTube or a movie, it still gets hot on backside as well as on screen. My fingers start to sweat. Suddenly the screen just glitches and I have to turn screen off and on to use it. When my phone is locked and a call comes, the screen stops working and notification bar gets disappeared. I have to again turn off the screen and turn it o...

It has heating issue which one cannot handle. Please avoid buying this phone
The company is not taking responsibility for the product. The are not sending software updates and also not updating the security patch. Today is 22nd January 2019 and the security patch is of 1 November 2017. That means no update in whole 2018. I am not satisfied with the product but still this phone has been used for 2 years approximately and is still in working condition and that is satisfactory.
best phone in this price

Pathetic Device!!! This phone has severe microphone problem. I returned and got a new one too. Even then, it doesn't work at all. The person on other side of call cannot hear what the user is saying. LENOVO has performed really poor here. Didn't expect this from FLIPKART as well. FLIPKART is continuously marketing such products with discount etc. that have issues, hiding the truth that they have received extremely negative feedbacks from users.
The device utterly fails in performing its primary duty of abetting a glitch-free conversation.  The awe of 4gb ram at this price point is overcast by the grevious performance of the mic/receptor which refuses to carry your voice even with the minimum acceptable clarity to the person at the other end of the line.  After having tried  numerous antedotes (suggested on lenovo fora) viz. multiple factory resets, uninstallation of all 3rd party apps, system upgrades etc., the invincible malaise re...

Product with manufacturing defects
Bad cell phone and hang slowly
this is very smart phone and this is very international  storage
very good work
Initially it works good. But, after a year it became so slow, that I could hardly use for internet. Touch screen has become unresponsive. It got broken previously. So, I had to replace the screen. But,. Due to it's poor quality, again the screen broke. So, I have decided, not to buy any Lenovo phone ever.
network problem
Initially the phone worked good. As the days pass by and the upgrade of the Android version the phone works as if it had got only 1gb of ram. Moreover the phone heats this time and lso hangs a lot when playing games.
Best features but internet on then few minutes hanging problem
Not proper work
good phone
Speaker phone is not working perfectly. Service centre is worst. They are not worth of keeping a service centre.
Good
nice product nice camera nice design
Nice phone..,
Mic quality is very poor. .. when I call someone my voice is not clear to him.. I have to use earphones to make my voice clear during calling... . Without earphones it becomes very difficult to talk with someone .

Good & nice mobile 👌👌👌👌
Never ever buy any phones from Lenovo. It has lot of intermittent software issues. The phone doesn't function as you wish to function it, but it functions on your own. It switchea off on your own. In normal hand, it prevents you to touch saying pockwt mode and in pocket it makes call to someone without your knowledge. Really a piece of waste it is. Never ever buy it. If you are buying, then be sure to repent for yoyr purchase after some day.
Hang problem

Most bogus phone ever . The software is the worst and practically unusable . Lenovo doesn't even care to fix the software issues . The hardware maybe good but the software is bogus and so the phone is practically unsuable.  Hangs a lot , worst battery life , can't even place calls most of the time . It's needa to be restarted once every 4 hours or so . Very bad software support from lenovo.
It works very nice and good
Nice and gentle.

After almost a year this mobile hangs frequently...👎
Phone is awesome but battery backup is not good. It's a 4000 mah battery and it does work full day compared to redmi 4.
Good phone from almost all perspective,happy with battery life. 2 things of dislike, photo quality in original when you download in your system(laptop,pc) is not the same, when you watch it on phone -- if you start navigation, you will not be able to access any other applications, phone will become dead slow, you have to either close GPS or rest of the applications
Worst mobile..
After few days speaker doesn't work
Ok
Supar

This is absolutely great but at this price. Nice display, awesome battery back up of upto two days, one app two user feature , finger print sensor is quick and accurate and every other this is cool. I miss my phone as it was snatched recently. :(  I used it for 5 months.
After 6month not charging,hanging problem
worst phone in my whole life.....working of touch suddenly has been stopped and then automatically this phone is in out of warranty...in 5 months 14days.

Some times straking & touch not working......
The speaker is damaged and battery life is worst along with charging device. So when iPhone doesn't have a useful battery and a good speaker how can you call it as his phone it's just a machine it's a damn machine that's it nothing else we can't call it as a phone if the worst worst and the most worst device I've ever seen in my life.
Display is not working properly
Product is good...But it delivered very late..

Nice phone. Working fine till now. I am not really a heavy user. I have not yet had any heating issues as such. Battery performance is good. But the mobile hangs a bit at times. But the hanging issue is a temporary one. Could improve a bit on performance

Worst product to buy. Within a week the phone voice went low and not able to hear anything. Service center is even more worst. They are not covering it in warranty and not giving any time line for solving the issues. Worst experience....

Amazing product , no problem in this Mobil
A good phone for the price. Good battery, lasts a full day without recharge. First Lenovo phone I wasn't tempted to install a stock ROM on. Inserting and removing SIM is tricky but all new phones are like that these days. Overall, I would recommend it, before it becomes outdated.
Ok

I have ordered three Lenovo K6 Power after seeing first phone's good performance. But after using for 5-6 months I am kind of disappointed with the performance of all three phones. They hangs at times and specially when any update going on like OS related or even app updates. If network coverage is poor then also they hangs. Quite disappointed with Lenovo for this kind of performance.
Good product

Phone is ok after 6months of use. Camera is not so good. Heating problem.
This is my review after using this phone for 7 months .Most people would say good bang for buck but this phone doesn't feel like one with 4gb ram . Camera and sound quality are good , screen colours and brightness are also quite good . Sensors are average and are unresponsive some times . Performance is not up to mark . I have seen better performance in a Samsung with 2 Giggs of ram and older processors. Looks are not good ,infact it looks like an ugly MI phone . Only thing this phone is wort...

Nice...its Good
Worst product. Very poor customer support.
Very poor quality. I ordered this phone. Since i had to ship to my friend, not opened the package after delivery. After 30 days my friend opened the box and surprisingly the SIM tray is not available. Checked with all Lenovo service centers. Most of them say no stock of simtray. Now 1 service center is asking for Rs. 2000 for sim tray alone. Also within a day of usage by replacing other handset simtray, touch screen is not responding as expected.
Mobile super but my mobile is at present touch error
The worst mobile i ever had..Please dont waste your money on this mobile.
My experience with this phone is not good . Heating is major problem for this phone , whenever you talk long or start talking after charging then this phone generating heat. Even mouthpiece is worst always other end of person complaint about echo of the voice or its not audible .  Only good feature is its Dolly sound , which is very good in this range of phone .
Good
Nice. Product but this is very costly
Got Lenovo k6 power 15days back good one nice battery n in low cost getting 4gb ram  n 32gb memory.but only one problem either 2 sim cards or one sim card n 1 memory card

Nice product. Flipkart is best for me. Superve feedback lenovo. Thanks flipkart.
Very exlent product and buttery pack very good
The mobile performed well for a period of 4 months and thereafter started giving problem in receiving and delivering the phone calls. The external speakers inly work. The internal speakers do not work, voice of the speakers on the mobile side can not be heard by the receiver on the other side. Feel helpless, the money invested has gone down the drain.
Software update to 7.0 but similar to Android 6 nothing more change.4gb ram is good for playing game and memory management.camera not much good compair to mi note 4.low light images are yellowish.battry good last very good on full working. Mic is not so Good
Worst experience. Eckart has started selling his products in Tempo. Tells his Customer to Come where their delivery Tempo is Standing and collect their products

Brilliant performance I love it
V nice. Good Service
Cool phone at this spec but little heating issue while continue use
After 10 months of usage and updation to naughet....  pros - rear cam resolution is top.  Battery backup is 2 days with decent use. No heating issues detected.  Cons -Battery backup dropped from 4 days to days after upgrade.  Processing issues and touch screen issues including call receive screen blank problem was detected later rectified by resetting the device.  Unwanted app upgrade drains battery a lot.  User interface is unattractive when compared to MIUI.
Worst mobile

On first impression the phone is good. Unfortunately the display lags in quality and patches are visible now just after 6 months. Better avoid.
Nice phone
Very good
Is not working properly,charging complaints will be occur
The phone is worth for the money. It's almost a year I had it. Now it started hanging (that would be due to the way I'm using it) The sound quality is out of the world due to the stereo speakers. At this price range this is the only phone which has stereo speakers.
Nice mobile but sometimes doesn't understand what happens to this mobile it just stop working and then I have to restart it....

It's ok config is good but not so fast sometime hang but good battery gallery works slow
Worst phone by Lenovo. Facing problem from the day I received it. The 4G network does not work and they cal it 4G phone. Customer service in pathetic worst I ever seen. They will just keep submitting the phone and no conclusion moreover top of that there customer care is non responsive and do not provide details and answer of solution. Do not waste your money buying a phone from Lenovo.

Amazing phone with long lasting battery and memory
Less rating due to non availability. Excellent performance of 4GB RAM and good RAM management. Never felt hanging and finger print sensor was pretty fast. I'm giving less rating because of non availability of Dark grey colour. I suggested my friends and they bought it. No regret in performance and camera in that price segment. Felt happy even while playing heavy games.

Sound effects fine
Worst pho e from Lenovo. I am cheated by Lenovo. Nothing works. I thought it is due to Android OS 6 but when I updated it to Nougat it  stopped unlocking my phone and requires 30-50 seconds to do it using hardware power key. I need a return of this buggy product.
Every thing is best in this class. Mic and headphone Jack is not upto mark.
I have a problem with headphone so I will claim soon
Nice phone working very well.

This is worst product. When i took this phone from day one it has voice problem. I had shown three times in service center. They replaced phone mike three times however the issue has not been resolved. Phone was hanging multiple time. It was quite uneasy to use. I purchased this phone around 10-March-17. However i couldn't use it regularly due to above issues. So i need to purchase another smart phone unnecessarily as i was not at all able to use this phone. When i approached Lenovo customer ...

Worst piece that I have got from Flipkart. The screen doesn't respond quickly, phone lags for even low graphics games and for minor apps, batteries has bugs , 4 gb ram it's like just for saying the performance is worst. This is the worst product, pls don't buy it.

It is good product
Speaker issue, slow processing while opening common settings, lots of bug, not enough support to fix bug by Lenovo, both the Sim are not hybrid like only one Sim support 4G and other default to 2G. Better buy other brand and model. Not the worth for money at this value.
A very good phone and battery lasted well everything was perfect..but the issue started after nougat update... Has volume problems goes to silent mode often... Half the apps dont work well.. needs frequent restart.. will be good if there is a patch...
Very worst mobile,, I keep approaching the service centre so many times
This phone is very good as expected. It's having good battery backup.
Very Bad...
This is a bed product of flipcart
Thanks

Good  mobile
Nice handset
Mouthpiece not gud... must use headphones
This bad
I've had this for six months now and the performance had improved after the Nougat update. I noticed some performance issues 3-4 months in, but now it is much better. The ram management has improved considerably. However the Google assistant might take a little getting used to. I'm having a minor issue though: the headphone jack has developed a problem of late. I've noticed that slight tugs on the headphone cable can disrupt the functioning. I have to push in the cable tightly for it properly...
Good

Nice phone from Lenovo in this price range,with all the features
Good mobile
Hanging too much. Battery life is not good even though it is 4000mah.
Device keeps on freezing, hangs even on moderate use.   Overheating is the main problem. I cant even return the product as poor customer care support. They cant even  do replacement.
I would give 5 out of five for battery back up. easy to handle in single hand. Good performance.
Awesome cell
Very problematic touch screen
Within week complaint given but no replacement and cash back.Damaged price received.

Excellent product recieved
No doubt, good phone.
Hang problem
Superb
Good phone
Bad phone it's hang nd automatically switched off & on worst phone ever
Only drawback is no separate folder for camera, WhatsApp pictures and video so difficult to sort out at times. Rest amazing product at this range. 3rd Lenovo phone. Good packaging.
Defective product and technician is unwilling to replace it even though there is a major defect in microphone.
Phone is good but from the beginning the charger is a faulty one....
Waste product
Ya it's good but very small size  item
good
Nice phone in budget
Very good
Nice phone.. battery is awesome and charging time is quite less as compared to Redmi... generally it will take 1hr 30 minutes for 0% to 100%.. sound quality is also good as compared to redmi
Flipkart delivery was good as expected. K6 is an amazing phone. I like the camera which allows you to quickly focus and click pictures. Finger print sensor is pretty responsive. I don't find any lag while performing heavy duty tasks. Only CON is the hybrid sim slot. If you are planning to use the second sim then 32gb of storage would eventually run out, since you don't have a dedicated memory card slot.
Don't ever purchase all lenove set..software issue a big problem with this set
After a few months it's hanging a lot..
Awsm mobile
product is good and it was delivered within 2 days
Good modal
Lagging. Issue with network. One star for battery.

It's nice to use and handy to utilize. I loved it lot.
Very good but mice problem in it
It's good
Very nice product  and handy
The main problem with this phone is the buttons are all on the right side of the mobile so at least 100 times during usage accidently you will end up locking or turning off the mobile.  Pls do not buy this product. I purchased it as I got an attractive discount and regretting it to the bits.
a very nice product in this range.
This is very bad product because they have many problems like hanging & battery problem.
It's very good product
Good bought... Bought it for 9999/- during offer period. Camera, RAM and 5 inch screen worth buying.
Mobile is good but service of this mobile company is very bad
Me and my frnd bought this phone. My frnd  phone as no issues. Whereas my phone as got heating issue while charging.. when I requested for return, the technician refused take back saying that they won't look for heating issue while charging
This is a very waste of cost and fully heated

Very good mobile. If it allows to insert 2sims and memory card at a time then it will be more flexible for the mobile users.
Lenovo k6 power is good in battery camera & ram, but not so good in processor
Very bad product, dont buy this phone, issue speaker problem... I am requested to filpkart to replace the phone but Flipkart dont replace, very poor service from Flipkart...
the mobile is started hanging problem after three month of buy.
Used it for two months till it came in contact of rain water, not much though! The screen stopped working and so as the phone. Went to service centre but of no use. Since the motherboard panel is somewhat attached to touch screen portion need to change them both which will cost more than the phone cost. How can lenovo come up with such a cheap product which cannot resist few drops of water!
Phone is haing problem not good
Nice mobile
Awesome phone in this price... Really awesome.

Every time during charging mobile is heating to much & automatic voice navigation started & not able to switch off that easily

Product is good, but seller sent me already used phone by someone, as I open the box and on the phone when I open Google chrome I saw, there's someone used in history open some vulnerable sites. Then only I realised that how could anyone open the phone used it and again sealed it.
the phone is very thick
Good
Super product
One of the best mobile I ever used. Good battery back up 4000 MAH so every body should go for the product to buy this and it's only 10000 . Some issues are like you are choose either dual sim or 1 sim and and SD card . SD card I think not necessary for this mobile because it gives you 32 GB internal memory where user can use 24 GB. Everything is fine for this product . I did not find any problem from last 7 months.
Quite satisfying
Good
Good one
Hang all time and charger also not connected
One edge of the touch screen is not working right from the time of unboxing the phone.
The phone is good, awesome battery life and HD display is good...Flipkart packed it very well
Heeting problem when charging and operating application
Very poor device ever that I've purchased so far.
Last 6 month I am using this mobile .Till now I didn't face any issue.its seems to be worth
Fully paisa vasul mobile.. excellent battery..

Nice phone according to price but have some mike issue exactly can't say why it happened might be because of system update,anyway problem solved in service centre.
Good
I am not satisfied with new coming Lenovo mobiles. Before I was much liked these products.
Be careful when you are buying it from this seller (IndiFlashMart). Phone display, motherboard and battery needed to be replaced within 3 months. Had to spend extra to get it repaired at Lenovo service centre, since they were not willing to cover it under warranty.
Very bad mobile / after one year speaker not working.flipkart delivered at correct time.
Get phone in low price

Nice product.....and app
This is the worst phone I have ever seen from Lenovo. Battery life is not good. Takes ages to charge full. I think the Software is not compatible with the hardware of the mobile. Hence I can see the lots of complaints about the low voice and hangings issues which I am facing is faced by other users as well. Please buy some basic phone with the money you have and save your time and money both. Because its the dumbest phone ever in the name of smart phone..
Not good mobile 3mont before problem
World's worst company ever. It has hardly been 3 months I purchased this phone I had to visit the service centre thrice. Other companies provide upgrade to improve the performance of the system but this company provides virus really very disappointed by using this phone I upgraded my phone to nougat as I received the notification to upgrade. But after the first upgrade my screen was blown. So I had to visit the service centre they made it right. Then after 20 days again I got one notification...
Nice product works well no issues

Taking Mike problem this mobile
Brought this phone in February 2017, worst phone ever I suggest you ppl not to buy this, have problem with hardware since I brought this, service center says it is common with this phone, restarts every time no apps open in this, pls don't buy this phone
It's a good phone.
Mic problem
I bought this phone for 11000 rupees from flipkart. I believe that a mobile phone should have clearing speech delivery, clearing hearing, good messaging capability and optimum range capture capability. All others features are up and above these features. This phone fails to have good speech delivery. People on the other hand CANNOT HEAR. Many features , good for the price....But if the piece cannot deliver what I am talking to the other hand properly, it is USELESS as a phone.....kind of like...
Good product
Worst phone don't buy it.....
Niceee product.
Nice mobile phone
It was an amazing one
Thanks for the best
I ordered this lenovo k6 power and recieved it today but unfortunately the mobile charger is not working i want to return this charger

Given the defective piece. Camera quality was very bad.
Got dull quality display phone.. when comparing with other k6 power then i realize my phone display is very dull quality and not good brightness level. Sorry this time i am frustrated with quality of lenovo phone. And also phone is out of warranty. Just one month ago purchased phone from flipkart is out of warranty now. Just think about it flipkart. You doesn't care about your customer.

Mic Problem.... not working properly...i bought last june 15 2017, Issue not resolve till now.
Overall good phone
Mobile comes with hybrid sim slots. Where you can use one sim and one memory card or dual sims in both slots without memory card. There is no gallery application for this mobile. Except these drawbacks (sim slots n gallery application) rest all are good. I just given 3 star rating for this product.
Excellent and very user friendly
Very good product..I m using this for more than a month..awesome product..Dolby Atmos speaker sounds good..camera is amazing..best mobile for college students..
Good one
Just cheated. Flipkart =Cheater. Microphone is not working properly. Technician came and just reported the reverse. They denied to replace or refund.
good phone
Product is God but coriear is very bad . Very God product is this use in 3 month the camara is bad and dots and line in pictures
New phone recieved on 16 July at the same time we open the box and insert sim  and make the call at the same time we know that it's speaker and mic not working
I got Lenovo K6 power from flip kart - delivered much earlier than expected. I am using this one for the past 1 month and I am happy. Charging is very fast and battery does not get discharged quickly - hence we get quite a bit of battery for talking (despite playing games in between). The phone is quite handy (I was using 5.5" one earlier) and sturdy too. As it is Volte, my Jio network works very well. However, my existing Blue tooth head set does not work properly with this (not sure if it i...
Excellent battery... Easy to handle...
The product is very bad in last 3 months 4 time I had visited to service center & get reputed still it is not working properly

It Was Nice But After Two Weeks I Got Problem in The Mic. The Mic Stopped Working Properly.
Highly recommended.
Nice mobile, best in price range
Mic is not working within 7months
If there is zero rating I will give that. Most faltu phone. My money is waste by buy these phone. Phone is getting heating in used few mins. My money is gone.dont waste your money. I try to return it but failed.
Phone is awesome but screen size is small and not looks like 5 inches.... otherwise mobile is fine
Waste of money... Sound problem came out within one month. Completely dissatisfied with this smart phone..
Nice phone
Nice phone
Not working properly.
nice mobile
Very nice
The best thing about this phone is the speaker (Dolby atmos) which gives comparatively  more sound for playing music. Then I like the battery which you require to charge only once a day even when you use 4G network with  good usage. Otherwise you can charge only once in 2 days with normal usage. The performance of the phone in terms of speed is really good if you are using a 4G SIM with good network connectivity. The front camera is also very nice. All in all, a great budget phone with great ...

Good but some minor problem in microphone
Phone is good ....but in service center it's products are not available.... I need camera upper glass......it was broken

Glass is broken in just 1 st. Time when it's dropped.. .
Nice mobile and very good battery backup
Mobile while over heat
Lenovo Products are Worst ... I never suggest anyone to buy LENOVO
It's a ok phone...I had to factory reset my phone for it to function properly. Overall I would not recommend it in this range
Go for it...
this phone has hanging problem. Everytime when i press the power on button it takes 1 minutes to show the lock screen. which irritate me alot
Mic of phone is not working..other features are good
After three months of usage, all i can say is it is best product in this price range.
Awesome Phone Cheers ☺️
Worst phone
Good
Overall phone is good. But there is microphone problem. You cannot talk using microphone but have to plug earphones for the same and then it is okay. The battery backup is good.
It's an amazing product
The phone is great but after the Nougat update the notification pannel lags alot hope lenovo solve it soon.
Product recieved in good condition on time

Mobile got heating up while charging can't hold in hand at all
Sim automatically single switch off and mobile  heating

If you're looking for a basic phone - for calls, camera and WhatsApp, the Lenovo K6 has worked best for me.
This phone was delivered in perfect condition. It is a good performing phone and has not given any troubles yet.

Mobil over heating
Writing this review after two months of usage. Mic has issue and it has been rectified with free of cost.
No warranty. Within two and half months it didn't work when given to authorized service person at Bangalore they said litmus paper inside the mobile has changed colour because of water has gone inside.  Even though pleaded that no rain in Bangalore he said mother board not functioning because water had gone inside. I was told even if a drop of sweat when we talk goes in litmus paper will change.  Lenovo does not guarantee when litmus paper changed and mother board failed.  Please don't buy Le...
You can not give permissions to the new apps installed, you get the popup "screen overlay detected" . This is very annoying problem . I don't recommed it to gift.
MICROPHONE! It's not like the microphone is all messed up or anything, but a strange observation was made; it worked normal when WhatsApp(or any other VoIP) audio/voice call were made. But when there were normal calls, the person on the other side faced problem in hearing it clearly, complained about the voice was from very far or was robot like. Similar thing happened when a video call was made. Otherwise the microphone was working fine. Not sure if this is a software (if the software is not...
Amazing mobile with features I loved it
it is hanging & very slow response
Product is nice, but phone gets heated.... battery life is superb....
Good phone battry is good.
Amazing features n superb performance with a very low price tag.
Don't purchase this phone until Lenevo solve their headphone problem . You can't talk using a headphone through Skype , what's app or any other video chatting aap . If Lenevo is able to resolve this problem then I suggest to go for this phone if you have a budget of 8 - 10 K . Touch screen not good but other features are good as far as budget is concern . If you don't have any budget constraints then don't go for this phone .
Nice product touch screen good and delivery fast

Awesome product . Received it within a week a bit disappointed with the front camera quality.

2 star
Micro phone is not working properly. The person I am talking to is not able to hear anything properly, many times I need to shout on phone so that the person whom I am talking can hear a bit. Remaining features are quite ok, but talking is the basic feature of phone. I am unhappy with this purchase.
One of the top most phone at this price
Some time Automatic​ screen hang and any app open
Best
Always heating up. If it is for games it's OK. Even for using apps like Twitter Facebook Instagram it's heating like hell. Been getting headaches too after speaking for some time. Lenovo k5 doesn't have this problem. Hope Lenovo rectifies this problem. Should've gone to Lenovo k5 .
Poor Quality. Voice point not working in a new phone. Call breaking in every call. Battery not charging in a new phone. Both Lenovo and Flipkart not responding to help. Don't buy.
It's good but camera and voice call quality is too poor .
It's hanging
gd one...
Mobile was very heat
Nice mobile... But display quality is not good...
Very good mobile, worth buying it, thanks Flipkart
Very very upset about the product. Network reception quality is very bad. Touch screen sensitivity is very very poor. Overall very poor quality of phone comparison to price.

Very heavy mobile. Not recommend for ladies & one hand operators. Within 6month span my mobile visited 2 times for service. Battery issues and screen issue. Mobile is very heavy compared to its size. I suggest to go for Mi Note 4 and other models.

Great value for money. Go for it!

The phone is just too good. Excellent camera, great performance and no problem in playing any games. Really smooth,  love this K6 powee :)
Samrt looking phone
It took me little time to recognise that the Bluetooth was not working. By the time I recognised it was too late to return back the product..Also the phone heats up very easily. After 6months the charger also stopped working
Very nice
It's nice mobile
My only concern is battery but it is not upto mark.
Volte was not working after updating mobile software
Great battery backup.. front & back camera is cool.from last two month no issues found & complete satisfaction..:)
Amazing battery backup and camera
Not recommended, it's very slow and sound quality is also not good. The service of and season given by Lenovo is non satisfactory. I have given the phone for repair 3-4 times in just 6 month's from purchase. The phone is not at all recommend.

Lenovo is a good brand. But the only problem in this is network. Sometimes network falls down. Not able to connect. In the same location others have network but my mobile didn't. Previously I purchased Lenovo K3 note and I faced the same problem in that too. No use after giving it for service. Rest all features r good.
No one phone under 11k
I highly satisfied with Lenovo K6 power mobile phone & assurance by filpcard deal..
It is nice product and i satisfied from the service of flipkart.

Amazing product although looks like RedmI brand mobile . Highly reccomended

Unprofessional response. More like a desi Lala ki dukan. Plz b always ready to take the responsibility of your defective products.
Never buy this mobile. Worst performance in terms of battery life. It has 4000mah battery and doesn't even last full day. Waste of money. Charging twice a day in less then 6 months of time. Not sure how a big brand like lenovo can sell such underrated products on flip kart. Also very sad that flip kart doesn't even check the specs when selling exclusively on their site. Very very disappointed.
Don't know why reviews sayings mic problem. Till now no issue. Let's hope for future. Simply a beast on price segment below 15000
Good product
Worst Phone, lot of problems, contacted service centre 2 times, not satisfied, finally after 6 month sold it in cashify. Bad experience.

Exchange policy not good, but phone is good, purchase this phone in exchange but puck up boy said that I am not accepting any exchange, screen have scratches and all, this is very wrong
Wonderful marvelous phone
The overall performance is good. Good backup but the 4GB ram model performance is not as expected.
Phone is good at this price. Although the delivery service is so poor. My order is shipped at nearest hub to my place but still they are saying that it will kept for 2 more days. Such a poor service! Not at all expected from Flipkart. Not even worth of 1 star. Poor service.
This phone is upto mark & does meet my expectations. The camera quality is good & there is inbuilt feature that adjusts the light conditions & removes the marks on your face. Battery life is also decent. Must go for this phone if your budget is 10-15k.
Nice product
Good budget phone.

Please don't buy this mobile all problems

Lenovo K6 Power Phone which i received had not worked properly. Phone gets hang up and freezed eventually. Also the speakers are not working.
Really a good product happy with it
This phone is having mic issue from beginning and after searching on net, it seems, everyone have this issue. very disappointed with Lenovo, why they are not solving it permanently. i  will never buy Lenovo in future. :(
GOOD MOBAIL
Having speaker problem. Otherwise nice one.
Poor fon
working good
There is a genuine mic problem, on a call the person at the other end will have a hard time hearing you so u have to repeat your self everytime which is annoying. Rest everything is perfect for the price it comes. If you are willing to use the phone with bluetooth head set or wired handsfree then you can go for it.

With in 2 months we got issues and not recoverable. Not satisfied with the product. Please don't buy. And, strongly recommend all, DO NOT BUY any China mobiles like Lenevo, Oppo, Vivo, Motorola, Xiomi, Red MI etc. All these mobiles are not having a good  quality. Few of them are blasting.

Very bad decision
Mobile was very waste

It just killed it.
I loved it.
Not so good
Works well and has great features. I absolutely love my phone!!
Over heating & touch is not working properly. Flipkart made me tired by asking lots of questions regarding product but it was worst experience. Make sure you will not get proper support while replacement and reviews for over heating true only so stay away if your usage is very heavy.
The sound recordings is not very sensitive & very feeble  hardly hear any record when it is played
Gud but not up to the mark
Very good mobile handset, camera quality is so nice.

Very good device
Nice..worth for money
Best mobile at this rate...
It's Working as per my expectation so i am satisfied with this product.
Excellent smart phone thanks to Lenovo
Phone is not bad, however the quality of headphones should have been improved. Basic phone earphone were provided for 10k product, which is not good.
I have purchased a Lenovo k6 power.delivered to me at 19 may. But many problems occur in the phone within days.touch of this phone is very worst. Many times hanging and Aoutomatic apps open and close automatic phone call to any person.Like that used or unrepaired phone delivered. So I suggest do not Purchased this phone otherwise you suffer.
Battery backup is issue in very short period. Finger print issue occurs some time.censors r very high
I had this phn in 31st may, in 1st June it hangs several time. Then i place a replace order. I got the new phn yesterday Noon, but in the evening it hanged again, and till now it remain hanged. I told the customer executive to refund my money, but they wont. We are many of the victims of this situation. I think i'v lost my money to buy this phn.
Display didn't work.
Good product for this price
Not best, but good mobile in this price

I started using this phone from past 3 months. It's working fine and upto now i didn't get any problems. Phone is not getting slow even using multi functions at that same time. Charging is coming 2 days. I like this phone and it's worth buying.

Amazing handset one of the best at this range, love gaming no hang and no heating so far, and just lovedd the Dolby speaker it's the beat. Camera is also good. Battery on 4g network after watching lot of you tube and calls works for entire 1.5 day.

I don't like... Touch and hardware issues... After replacing... Not happy  and sold...
Phone Hangs sometimes in a day it has to force restart. Battery backup is OK.
After reading many reviews, just taken care not to update the software after switching ON. Now it is quite fast and no mic problem or any other problem. And dolby speakers sounds really good.
Awesome 👍👍👍
The phone hangs up even with basic multiple tasks ( no gaming on ) they surely could have done better
Good product
Awesome 📱
Waste mobile no battery backup

Good product, slightly heavy
Best mobile in my budget
Best phone under 10000.. All things are good in phone camera is super in this budget segment. Full HD display. Dolby atmos support big battery... Amazing....
One of the worst buys ever, basic functionality of a phone is to be able to make calls and answer them, there is a bug issue when people are not able to hear you, completely dissatisfied with Flipkart and with Lenovo this will be my first and the last buy from Lenovo
Hanging problem
Superb phone from Lenovo.
The smartphone is really wonderful . And good at this price range.. well done by Lenovo
A handy phone with excessive battery backup, only problem is the heating issue
Good
Worst phone my value for money camera every poor met no Speed not working like a 4g phone
Very Nice
Important Caution ! Being little expert mobile technology would like to suggest you about this mobile heat issue, charge with Micromax charger you  zero % heat. Enjoy :)
This phone is a choice of smart people. You won't regret after bringing it home. A budget phone with very impressive battery power and all smart features. Go ahead if you have planned to purchase it.  It's fast focusing rear camera won't let you miss out special moments. Overall rating I will give 8.5 out of 10
Very good
I am very happy. Thanks flipkart.
Sometimes it gets hanged
Masst phone. Both cammer nice. Sound colty masst
Flop App No Refund policy
Nice.......phone.....this..is the best model of lenovo
Mic problem

Headphones are defective. Only one speaker is functional. Please exchange the defective headphone with a functional one
Nice
Good product in a nice budjet
The phone performance is very well in this budget. The camera quality is average. But the only two thing i didn't​like about the phone is the flash. In dark the picture is fully yellowish with the flash. Nd i cant chang the function of long pressing navigation keys.
Mike issue...bad quality product dont purchase
Good product
Great budget phone. But sometimes gets hanged while typing. Overall performance is good. Charging takes 4 hours.

Super fone
Tanyou fipkart
Sounds problem
I got this phone on 24th March. After using 50days I got a problem with charging. After consulting Lenovo service centre they told me that it is mother board problem. They took nearly 10days to solve my problem. Now it is working good. Cemaras are excellent especially selfies are very sharp and clear and perfect. Battery also running good.
Very good phone but the phone is heating in the first day itself
Third class phone
Mobile body hit when charging or play game also many time voice is very low of caller not proper listen.
Overall it's good. Battery is super awesome (that's what it's made for!).4gb ram is more than sufficient. Hybrid slot for Sim/SD card. Camera quality is not that good (thou it has some features such as smart capture/continue  mode/various photo modes and slow motion/time lapse for video). It's a bit slippery in hands. Prefer cover. It's a competition to redmi note 4. Your choice!
Kenobi ke power , nice phone with long hours of battery, smooth touch however sometimes scroll is not smooth. Quite satisfied with the performance. Further flipkart has offered exchange offer which gave me the value of my old phone.
Just fabulous..
Heating problem
Asome
Worst mobile I received from Flipcart don't buy online go to locally purchase
previously product was having touchscreen problem but was replaced by flipkart but only replacement was the option no refund option is there  this might affect thinking of the client and it is long procedure now the product looks in  good condition .........
Lenovo k6 power is a good phone

Very nice phone
I bought this Mobile on 5th of May at a price of 10999. Today,the same is offered for 9999 on Flipkart's website.
Bought this phone 1 week back all over phone is good but have issues with the OS and the seller from whom is bought have all defected mobiles. I would request you to buy this mobile in any store offline don't be fooled by the offers.
nic one
Best phone under Rs.11000
device is heating while using normally (even in while calling) , while charging and while playing games. This device is not as fast as for 4 GB RAM , 2 GB ram always utilized by system. apart from heating there is automatic turning on and off of the apps on the home screen while screen is locked and phone in pocket. Microphone is unpredictable while call sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't properly.
This product is very bad
No cons.. Awesome phone
Camera review was not good in day and night both, rather all stuffs are well built.
Very good
Nice mobile but earphone are waste
Worst phone of this year. After using 1 month my phone gets hanged sometimes when i use to silent my phone volume level donot go below 2 level and sometimes mx player not play video, voice is not come when i do video call on whatsup and imo but after rebooting the phone my phone work but after 4-6 days all problems repeated.
totally regret buying this phone...big microphone issue
Phone sound quality is superb. But headphones quality very very bad.
Listener is unable to get your voice, the basic functionality of phone is to call which this phone sucks.
Call quality and signal reception were pretty average. The only positives were screen, battery life and headphone audio quality.
Normally a good phone but heating problem
Mic is not working properly
Lenovo have high price than Samsung j7
good phone
Phone is good but the charger and usb cable is very bad
Awesome look , working is very smooth , battery backup is best  , camera quality also very good both back and front , best phone under this budget .
This phone is not good...
Good
Good
Mic speaker very bad.. otherwise all are Good..
Mic issue and speaker issue. I received a defective phone. Flipkart technician confirmed the defect and flipkart sent me a replacement phone. Now the replacement phone have same issue. But now I can't return it as Flipkart is asking me to reach out to service centre. Why should I pay for something if its defect out of box. As per flipkart technician this Lenovo phone has mic and speaker issue and they getting calls for same all the time but still Flipkart is selling defective product and not ...
It is good but not the best
Excellent phone
Very good nice
Mobile heat and hang
This is the worst phone. Please don't purchase it. Also flipkart doesn't provide good service and they are always ready to cheat you.
Good product from Lenovo

Battery draining first...
Good product
Its is the best mobile with all the feature
..camera &sensor are perfect ...great phone having good features  at average cost
Hi guys, please don't buy Lenovo K6 power with 4Gb Ram and 32 gb internal memory. it's causing mic issue. i bought lenovo on this month on flipkart. when i raise complaint to flipkart they simply suggested to contact nearest lenovo service point because of my 10 days replacement period is completed
Not got satisfied as expected..............I need to speak loudly or repeatedly near to the mic. Video call not possible to Samsung mobile with 4G volte carrier... completely disheartened. "Theme centre" which is the default app in the phone showing issues as it as a harmful app. Its for the 2nd time repeated those same thing. ..
Superb
Nice phone for this rate. I have purchased it two weeks ago and doing good.one problem  I face is that it takes time to get opened after pressing the power button.
tq flipkart for giving me a wonderful mobile...i loved it
nice phone...👌
1 no. Best product. Nice product👍👍👍👍
Good product , got on time !
Excellent battery life and worth for the money!!
Guys this is the best smartphone under 10000 thousand.And I suggest you just try it and I hope you feel much better than the other smartphone.
I'll give 5 stars as the phone is splendid! But, the charger I got along with the device has a problem. It heats up the phone while charging. It might be a rare issue. But if you face it, go for replacement of charger. If you look for a great cool phone, grab it now!

Best phone in the price... Battery is very good for these one week... Only disadvantage is if we are using two numbers then this hybrid slot is a waste one... Companies have to think abt that... In 32 gb. .os swallows 8gb.. only 23.99 gb is available
The phone is aweaome. Value for money, better than iPhone.. super fast, budgeted...go for it

Don't buy..... Lenovo k6 power is a very bad mobile set. I have purchased & within 1.5 month it's mic started not working, earphone & charger not working. Handset sometimes hanging.... I've did this mistake and I'd like to tell everyone not to buy this item. Very poor..... I can't tell you how bad is this mobile set.... If I have 0.00001 star rating I'll put for this set.
Phone is hanging
Worst phone ever

Good phone in small amount
Mobile ki vry gud at low cost
Best in this price!
Order & delivery of flipkart is awesome as all time. Using this phone nearly for around 3 months. Everything is working very good except microphone. The other side cant hear properly if talked in normal volume. Speed, battery backup, sound, camera and all other thing is very good at this price. Lenovo needs to work on microphone as this is the primary need of a phone.
Wow super battery power and mobile working speed super
Very good budgeted phone
Over a call Audio is very poor to other person. Our voice will be like when we speek from hallo room. Cam is ok, battery is ok, vedio is ok, display is ok.
Nice phone for its price range. Battery lasts a full day even after heavy use. The body doesn't heat up during resource draining games or on continuous video streaming.
Nice
Best mobile for this price rupees 11000
Good product.. satisfied..

No good work
gooD phonE, fasT deliverY, 100% satisfactioN

Really good phone , nice to use. Battery is awesome . camera quality is decent not great. Hybrid sim slot can be a deal breaker .
I have been using this phone 1 month, everything is good in this phone ,just sometimes it gets heat up slightly, battery back up is excellent and no major problem,It's a excellent phone so don't regret to buy this phone.
Awesome great features really nice
Good product from Lenovo with new and exciting features....and lots of research done by Lenovo makes different product in this price range .....Dolby Atmos and more exciting features make product awesome...
Very nice
Ultimate product and vendor
Don't buy this product... There's problem of speaker or also microphone.
I bought 4gb ram.Amazing battery backup 24 hour,front camera is good, Dolby digital voice for music & videos ,one pblm gallery app is not available.back camera is average.
good mobile and  great features
Phone is awesome , but the delivery was too much late and the response from Flipkart cc is worst and the rating is for Flipkart cc
There is a mic problem in Lenovo K6 Power and remaining all facilities are good. Especially the battery is one of the good thing and no need of power bank.
its camera and performance is not good...
Mic problem

Lenovo k6 power was delivered to me on 18th Feb 17.....3 months worked well...since 21May 17 same microphone problem started.. person on other side doesn't get any voice unless I switch on loud speaker.. although they mentioned a product warranty for one year..but it's very tough to get a Lenovo service center in non metro cities..can anybody suggest a way to get over the problem..
Very poor quality. Don't try to buy this.
Budget phone...good
All preformence is good bt  too much heated
Heating problem on using net and also while charging and mainly Mike problem...!!!
Not satisfied
Great phone value for money. One star less as the screen freezes when multiple apps are opened. Camera above average in daylight condition, . Poor in low light condition. But can't expect better at this price point.
Worst mobile phone continues heating problem
Worst phone I have ever seen.as soon as possible I want to exchange it.there is many more problem like hanging and heating and other problems I have to face.between 10 days I have to face this kind of problems.i have to rush to the service centre but they can't fix or replace my phone.
Product is best but it have no infrared to use this mobile like a remote.
Phone is good based on its budget. But it has heat problem. It used to hear a lot.
First of all thanx to Flipkart for timely delivery of mobile. I am writing this review after 2 months and till date Lenovo K 6Power works simply awesome. No heating issue . Fast processing of apps & games . Also charging is too much fast in this beast . Battery backup is really good and last whole day and night after heavy use also. Camera front and rear both are good . Finger print sensor is also lighting fast. Sound quality is at its best without headphones also because of Dolby digital,goo...
Very good article. Nice smartphone. Vale for money

Nothing new
Best android
Value foe money
good product
Phone is real good... But someone stole it yesterday.. Is there a way to find it.. finger print centre is activated.. will that help in anyway
The microphone fails to work within 20 days after the delivery. As smartly they have given 10 days of replacement, we have no chance to get it replaced. And No one like to get and use the defective product after investing 10K.
owsm sound and camera
Heating issue and mic problem
Super battery​
Worth for my investment
Nice one.Go for this
Ultimate phone its is better than redmi note 3
No way comparable to Redmi devices with same price. No IR blaster, Battery backup poor, Cam poor
Mobile having microphone issue.I stick a piece of cello tape on secondary mic solved the problem now.why Lenovo still now not solved problem till from 2016.almost all the users highlighted the issue.It is a bug in noice cancellation software caused the issue.An OTA update from Lenovo able to solve the issue.In the month of May-17 Lenovo committed the customer to provide the Android-7 update.let us wait and see the problem resolved
Great phone
Awesome Battery backup, best in class camera, looking, selfies camera is good, superb RAM management. I was used it more than a month.

Nice phone value for money
Issue with mic and Bluetooth connectivity
Nice..
Good and fast processer, with good camera and best speed
This praduct not good don't by friends . Out going voice call prablm
Had this phone for over two weeks. Installed so many apps ran them simultaneously no issue. As of now no heating issue. Voice quality is also good. Also great battery back up. I just charger it once a day use 4g or wifi while day still left with 20% battery at the end . Good phone for the price.
Not good ...buy redmi note 4
Perfect phone for use....
Worth it
Considering the price, Lenovo k6 power offers great value for money. Screen is vivid and colours production are good. Rear camera is good but the front is much better. Battery backup is good. Sound is exceptionally well both from speakers and in earphone. Device can handle high graphics games. Heating is not that much, it gets little warm during charging and intense 4g data use. The only drawback according to me is hybrid slot.
All battery, camera, ram, internal memory, working is best in this price.....
Marvellous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great phone with very good performance....
Mobile is good
Good
Ok for this cost
Nice product
Excellent
Simply great
It's not good for games,while gameing phone is heating
Not good
Very bad product
The best smartphone in my budget
The product is very good
Overall performance is good. Battery backup comes to one and half day with regular internet usage. But if used for gaming then hardly makes up to 6 hours. Heats like anything while charging. And also while using internet with 4g speed. It's been a month for me using this phone. Ones it has shown the notification as "phone is overheated please disconnect the charger"
It's too good
Good product
Heating to much
good
Best phone under 11k best in class camera cpu performance is best. But during charging phone gets heat upto 50 degree. Screen is good but it's metal body gets scrath quickly. FLIPKART TRICKING PEOPLE.
Worst product don't buy this. Mic problem and voice is also not clear.
Best mobile phone .Better than Xiaomi Redmi 3 s prime
Video recording......it means doesn't captured​ sound...
Go for this product

Just awsome. Best mobile at Rs. 11999/-.
The phone gets hot a little bit when over charged or over used but overall it is the best but  the mic is not very effective . I been using it since for a while but it has hanged only ones
Product quality is not  good. Mic is not working properly. One speaker isn't working in just a few days after purchase. Speed of RAM is very poor. Service of Flipkart is excellent. Product received on time.
Super
I had Lenovo k3 note and was satisfied with it, but when I bought Lenovo k6 power I found it better cell I need to have. This summary phone is awesome. Worth to money INR 12000 I AM HAPPY

This price is so good product
Voice clarity is a big problem since I use this mobile. Function  are less. It's backup and restore program is not effective. It  misplaced my old contacts​ too. Only battery life is OK
I did not like it.

Sometime it got hanged and lock it self and then I get problem but still the phone is awesome and the sound of the speaker is best thing I like about these phone
Worst phone i have ever seen, Many software bugs and heating around 45 to 50°
Phone was very het
I purchased this Phone 2 months back. Suddenly speaker did not work. I got it replaced from service centre.
Smooth touch, Battery good for browsing for many hours, smart power power saving when juice is low. But consumes more battery while play games from Gameloft, EA, etc. Some good features from Moto. Dolby Atmos is awesome in quiet environments - add power to music. In volte 2-2.5days, else more than that. Good budget phone. Daylight visibility is ok. Screen could be 5.2" or 5.3". Cam could be much better!
Good quality mobile in such budget..but mic quality is not good
Excellent Mobile in  every  aspect except screen  size which  should  be  5.5 inches instead  of  5 inches
It's working superb
Good mobile
Really Good,No problem,only one problem is there is screen lay out..but I restored the phone and it's ok..overall good

Hanging issue screen not working often,,,,,microphone is bad the person I call not heard my voice clearly
Not as expected
After using 2months I found that it is not up to the mark
Touch not working properly. Defected item.
I've been using this phone more than a month and can say it is really value for money... Minor heating problem noticed especially while charging... But can be ignorable..
Very good performance
Mic is not working properly nobody hear my voice on call the earphone quality is very bad and flipkart return policy is very very bad.
goods...........................................
Got it @6.3k in exange good one at this price
Waste phone do not buy it
Everything great except Mic and RAM Management.
Lenovo k6 power is good product  but there is a problem about overlay detect
Overall good performance .. I m using this from last five months.. and I totally satisfied with this. No hang very smoothly work.. sound system is awesome.. back camera clearity is ok ok..
Lenovo k6 power is aswme mobile
Phone is very good in every aspect , could have kept a extra slot for memory card with dual SIM though 25gb available space is good enuf.but we can very well save in a pen drive via otg
Good performance
One of the good product of Lenovo. I am using it for last 3 month no issues. Good product. One suggestion is only that screen should have to be 5.5 inch. In same price then it might be tough competition to Redmi note 4. Still satisfactory product. If one can go with it if he want 5 inch mobile.
Supar

The phone is simply awesome and​ in range..I loved it
I will not tell you about specification as they are listed already. It's one month now since I started using this phone and the experience is very good than expected at this price range. It has some heating issues but nothing of concern. I am using the 4gb ram variant and their is no need to clear the background apps ever. It is relatively light in weight. It's camera is better than any other phone in this price range. Though its touch is not that good.
Nice and handy mobile
I have brought this phone . 1st I have the speakers problem, I got replacement, but 2n one is having screen and sim problem, I didn't understand why Lenovo is selling this kind of product in the market. Too bad

Not really worth it if you compare some competitors. There are good specs but then it has a number of problems. Had to call for replacement at first - their product engineer came and fixed the battery issue instead of replacing it. But the product continues to function intermittently.

Phone is quite good. But it has hanging problem. when you end the ongoing call the mobile stop working. To use touch pad after call ending u need to lock the phone and again you have to unlock it. Touch pad is very bad. Camera quality is poor. Don't buy this phone
Mobile is handy , specifications r awesome for the price , few defects like front camera is bit dull , bit heavy , glossy finish for backpanel better buy a back cover which will have grip
